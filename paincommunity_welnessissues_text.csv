 I’m only 32 years old but look older when compared to other people of the same age. I have wrinkles and acne scars on my face due to acne problems. My concern is all about my saggy skin and wrinkles. I need to tighten my skin. Any treatment is alright but should be non-surgical. I have a limited budget. Can someone suggest an effective and affordable wrinkle treatment?

 Hey, I’m new, hi everyone!! I am diagnosed with fibromyalgia, spinal arthritis, and mild peripheral neuropathy, as well as bipolar. I have had these diagnoses for years. 
 However, around March of this year, I had a very sudden onset of symptoms that are only worsening. Severe fatigue…I mean SEVERE, as in my limbs are fatigued and I’m not working out, but I feel like I’ve been in the gym 5 days straight. I can not be awake an entire day, just physically can not. My pain is more intense, including weird random shooting pains in random areas. My limbs get weak and I can not walk or get up by myself sometimes. Tonight for the first time I’m having trouble gripping. Also, random itching, esp at night and sometimes it keeps me up. I’ve had some random things come and go since then, like weird vision stuff and intense facial pain. 
 My rheumy tells me it’s the fibro, but I’ve had that a long time and it doesn’t feel like that. My dr says its depression, but I’ve had depression since I was a child and I’m in my 30s. This came on suddenly and intensely, and I wanna cry bc its worsening and I feel like no ones listening and I’m scared and can barely function anymore. 
 I’m not looking for sympathy, I just don’t want to feel this way anymore. I don’t know what to do. I’m reaching out in case anyone has experienced anything similar and has any ideas of where to go from here. Thank you!!

 Hi Jaxx,  
 It sounds like your pain is overwhelming you. I’ve experienced fatigue and muscle spasms, but not to that degree. I know we have coached people with similar issues. The only thing that helped me was coaching. It is a good community of people who understand the issues those of us with chronic pain have to live with. I wish there was a quick solution, but for me, it has taken years. I use many tools to manage my pain and keep myself less depressed and more functional. It is a lifelong struggle, but well worth it. How have you been this week?

 Hey guys, 
My husband has been suffering from depression and anxiety problems for a while. He never attempted to talk about his issues to me, and it might be because he didn’t want me to feel anxious about him. We spend a lot of time together at home for the past few days due to COVID-19, and that really helped us to know each other than ever before. 
We talked a lot, and I got to know that he had a troubled childhood, where he was the first witness to his mother’s multiple suicide attempts. Even after 25 or 30 years, he still dreams about one of those old incidents, particularly, and he keeps thinking about it many times a day and gets emotionally stressed. It was the problem he had to go through in all these days. 
I wanted to help him, so I shared this with a psychologist I knew, and he told me that my husband might be experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder. After reading some articles about PTSD, I too got the same impression. 
I want to give him the  best PTSD treatment  as possible, so I would like to hear from people who had treated and recovered from PTSD. I want to get suggestions on doctors, clinics, therapies to deal with PTSD. Are there any specific meditations on breathing, regulating emotions connected to PTSD?

 Hey, 
Today, I’m here to help one of my best friends. She is battling with constipation problem for a while. She is the mother of two adopted children. Her husband is so busy with his business and never tried to hear about her problems. 
I remember the days she used to wear jeans and shirts. But, later, when she started to have heavy stomach pain as part of constipation, she has given up even wearing her jeans. And now she only wears sweats with a drawstring waist. She wears styles with no waistband now. When she shared her problems with me, I felt so sad. 
I suggested her to try doing some exercise, but exercising was so painful for her. She had consulted many doctors, but couldn’t find relief from this constipation problem. And the worst part is she is all alone in her battle. I really wish to help her. I discussed this with a few of my other friends, and I got different suggestions like, 
> eat more fibre foods 
> drink more water 
> do exercise 
> Use laxatives 
and many more. And what I found something more helpful is the use of laxatives. Many people are using laxatives as a solution for constipation, and I got suggestions to  use Colace clear capsules . I searched on this brand and found it’s a good one. I hope this would help her to get relief from her constipation problems. However, I would like to hear from those who had tried this. Are there any side effects for these laxatives?

 The topic of stress, pain and smoking cigarettes was raised during a chat last week. The comments shared were remarkable. Smoking tobacco has been shown to interfere with pain relief and may make existing pain worse. I am sure many of you have heard this remark ” just quit smoking” as it was as simple as that! Quitting cigarettes is one of the most challenging addictions to break. I would love to hear what others have learned or experienced with this effort. I know for me, it took time to realize that I was getting more and more colds and chest congestion that was taking longer to get rid of—my “ah ha” moment. Then I had to wait until the taste of cigarettes was no longer enjoyable (which I would occasionally experience) before taking the leap. I found fighting the urge was hardest when driving home from work or going out with friends—when you were allow to smoke in public places like restaurants and bars. I would say it took close to a year before those urges went away. How about you?

 I have tried to quit several times. It seems I use smoking as a stress reliever. Things go wrong or something happens that is stressful I reach for that cigarette. I have recently tried the ecig and by using that was able to cut way down and thought maybe I would make it that time. Then  one of our beloved pets got ill and passed away and I found myself back to the beginning. I beat myself up all the time about this, I think about it when I pick up a cigarette, I think about when I empty and ashtray or open a new pack. It isn’t that I don’t want to quit, it is as you said, very challenging and I just have not found my “ah ha” moment yet. I am not giving up, I will beat this.

 Well it has happened. I have finally arrived to the mindset that I want to quit. I have tried several times before but never really had it securely in my mind that I really wanted to do it. This time is different….I am there….I want to quit!        
 Today begins the journey. I am using one of the e-cigarettes to help ease the urge for nicotine. 
 I will win this battle! Anyone out there want to be my quitting partner? We can do this together!

 I need support, is there any one else out there trying to kick the cigarette habit? This is so hard, in fact one of the harder things I have done. I really do want to quit and the e-cigarette is very helpful but I keep falling off the wagon so to speak.  
 Any tips that you can give are so welcome.

 Noki4, How are you doing with the smoking cessation journey? 
I have never smoked but I really feel the struggle that others have when trying to quit smoking. 
Beating yourself up is counter productive.  Be extra gentle with yourself, Self compassion is so important to our survival and well being.  I used to beat myself up for all sorts of things.  I learned to stop doing this and now I have a little saying I have posted in various parts of the house. (on my computer screen, on the mirrors, on the inside of cupboard doors) each time I find myself saying something negative to myself about myself I say “I forgive myself for that thought; I chose love instead”  It really works. Try it and see what it does for you.

 Hi Dionetta, 
 It is an ongoing process. I have had some really good weeks and then some really bad weeks. I have not given up and will keep going until I have kicked the habit for good. Thank you for the support.

 Just spent a long weekend with an old friend who turns out to be a chain smoker. My lungs and clothes had a work out just being around her as she smoked in her home, in the car and elsewhere. She did ask if I minded, so I was trying to be gracious as she invited me to her home. Naturally, I say I was fine with it. I did not expect to be living in a tobacco cloud so much, tho. She had another GF arrive the second day who also smokes….not as much, thank goodness. I found myself abandoned several times at restaurants and pubs so they could go outside and smoke more. It became more difficult to overlook and be tolerant, I must confess. My tongue was bleeding from biting it. Finally, I did tell her that she was not only addicted to her cellphone (always on it) but to nicotine too! 
 I came back home wishing more than ever that Noki, Tndr and their spouses experience the very best of luck and strength as they continue to fight the nicotine battle—may you win BIG!!

 Petmom, I read your post and identified so much with what you were going through.  I used to say oh its OK…I’m fine… But I clearly was not OK and would suffer through it knowing that I would get a headache afterwards and if we were eating and they lite up I would get stomach cramps. And I hated the smell. So after much thought and talking to a counselor I decided I needed to stop being so accommodating.  I no longer will allow a smoking cigarette in my air space.  I do not have any friends who smoke.  and my family members who do smoke know they can not smoke around me.  I respect them for respecting my need to be smoke free. My apartment and car are smoke free zones. 
 Nicotine has to be one of the worst addictions. (glad I never started – I hated the smell and was repulsed by the thought of inhaling it) I have a sister who will quit for months at a time and then go right back to it.  One of these days she will be successful.  I have decided that I can be supportive when she wants to talk about it.  but harping on it does not work at all.  But she does not smoke around me…except if we are outside and wind is blowing the smoke away from me. 
"
"
 When I was out with friends and one of them did not smoke. I would never leave them sitting alone to go out and have a cigarette. Yes the urge is strong but you must choose which is more important, your friend or having a cigarette. I will pick my non-smoking friends every time. There is a big plus to having non-smoking friends — you don’t want to leave them alone so you smoke less when you are with them and around them. 
 This journey in quitting has it good weeks and bad weeks, but I refuse to stop trying this time. I will keep trying until it works. I figure as long as I am trying to quit something will have to work at some point and it will happen. Thank you, PetMom1 for being one of my cheerleaders, it means the world to me.

 I am a smoker for the past 20 years. I am addicted and really want to quit. Not a fan of e cigarettes due to the nicotine, I have decided to try CBD in a vape pen. It has great natural taste and takes the edge off when the urge arises. Find out more  https://bit.ly/2UqJ6wI

 Hi All, 
 I’m a 43-year-old male and was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea approx 18 months ago. 
 Although I believe I’ve had it since my late 20s. 
 I’ve been given a CPAP Machine or something along those lines and admit I hardly used it until I was told how severe my sleep apnea was. 
 Now I believe my machine is auto but it has been set to 15 whatever that means, as I said I wasn’t using the device due to it constantly waking me up with hard blasts of air. 
The problem now is I’ve been using it nightly for 2 months and feel absolutely awful. Any recommendations on other  Respironics machines will  be gratefully received. 
 Just to add I’m not grossly overweight I’m 5 10″ 
 Thank you!

 Hey guys, 
I have been working in a forging industry for the past few months. As you all know, the forge shop workers have to shape the metals through hammering, pressing and squeezing techniques. So we have to give extreme precision and strength to properly hammer, squeeze or rotate a piece of metal into the exact design. We also need to  apply heat treatment to metals  as needed. So this is the work I have been doing for months, and I have to work for hours in a stretch. I have been aching with chest pain and muscle aches now. It’s getting difficult for me to work for a long. Many of my colleagues are facing a similar problem. So I’m thinking about taking proper treatment to get rid of this. A few of my friends suggested me to went for massage therapy. Is massage therapy is a good option for treating muscle aches and all? Do anyone here have any experience with massage therapy for this? Or if you have any good suggestions, please let me know. I would be grateful for your thoughts on this.

 Anyone interested in sharing favorite recipes that help you manage your pain either by preparing or eating the dish? I would love to start a TPC online recipe section. How does that sound to you?

 I would love to hear from people that have very simple, easy to make recipes. I cannot stand long at the stove so what I make has to be made in the oven, crock pot or something that is quick to make on the stove top. 
 One simple recipe that I started making a long time ago is ground beef and pork n beans with barbecue sauce. You brown your ground beef, drain and then add in a large can of pork n beans. Stir and then add in about half of bottle of barbecue sauce and stir really good. Let that simmer for about 15 minutes. We like it served with corn on cob and some type of bread.  It is easy and fast, my kind of cooking.

 I just made this yesterday. It is easy and yummy. Allrecipes.com gets the credit for the meat recipe. The gravy is my own. 
 Slow Cooker Roast Beef and Mushrooms: 
 Choose your favorite cut of beef. I used a rump roast. 
Put 1 pound fresh mushrooms in bottom of crock pot 
Place meat on top; Sprinkle with onion soup, pepper to taste 
Add one can or bottle of beer. 
 Turn on high for 2 hours then reduce to low for 3 more (or) cook low for 6-7 hours. If the meat pulls apart easily it is ready. 
 Take out roast and allow to rest on a plate, cover with mushrooms. Pour remaining liquid into gravy boat if you desire au jus. 
If you desire gravy: Transfer juice to frying pan and bring to a boil 
In a separate container with a lid, add 3 TB flour, 1/2 cup milk, 2 TB sour cream (opt) 
Secure lid on top and shake vigorously to combine ingredients; open and slowly add to frying pan. 
Stir continuously until thickens into gravy. 
 Serve with potatoes, rice or noodles and a green vegetable.

 Now in time for the holidays here is one of my most favorite sweet potato recipes. They made this at the local hospital where I used to work. I adjusted it to serve 10 doctored it up a tad, so will indicate that by listing the ingredients as optional. Enjoy. 
 Sweet Potato Casserole 
 Preheat Over to 350 degrees 
 Filling 
 6-7 medium to large sweet potatoes (aka jams) 
1/3 c sugar 
3 eggs 
1 tsp vanilla 
1/3 c milk 
1/3 c butter (or margarine) 
1/2 Tb Amaretto (opt) 
 Topping 
 1/4 c brown sugar 
1/3 c pecans, chopped 
2 Tb flour 
2 1/2 Tb (1/2 stick) butter (or margarine), melted 
1 Tb Kahlua (opt) 
 Boil sweet potatoes until done (test with fork, should enter easy) 
Combine cooked potatoes with remaining filling ingredients into a large bowl. Beat with mixer at medium speed or by hand using a masher until blended. 
Transfer into a greased (spray, oil, crisco or butter) casserole dish. Press into dish so that about 1 inch space is left at the top. 
 Combine topping ingredients in a separate bowl. I food process the dry ingredients first then add them to the bowl followed by the melted butter. Mix so the topping is crumbly. Add to the top of the filling. 
 Bake for 30-40 minutes, covered except for the last 10 minutes to allow for browning. 
 Let rest 10 min before serving and then dig in! My friends and relatives love this version. It goes well with the holiday turkey dinner.

 Peanut Butter Chewies  
 These are super easy to make cookies. 
 2 cups Brown Sugar 
2 cups Peanut Butter 
1 Pint of Light Karo Syrup 
1 Large Box of Corn Flakes (you can buy the off brand—but get the biggest box you can) 
 Combine sugar and syrup; bring to a boil. Remove from heat as soon as bubbles appear. 
Add peanut butter and stir until peanut butter is melted; pour over the corn flakes in large bowl. 
 Drop by teaspoons on waxed paper. You want to do this quickly, the mix will harden fast. Yield: about 50 cookies 
 Storage: I use a large container with lid and I layer the cookies, using a piece of wax paper in-between the layers so the cookies do not stick together.

 Here is another holiday special that my childhood neighbor made every year:  
 Potato Candy 
 1/2 cup mashed potato (either leftovers or cook 1 med potato & mash) 
1/2 tsp vanilla 
1 box confectioner’s (powdered) sugar 
Peanut butter (about 1 cup); chunky or plain 
 Cool potato until warm in bowl. Mix vanilla. Add sugar gradually to mix well until stiff enough to roll–consistency of pie crust. Transfer to wax paper dusted with powdered sugar. Place another piece of wax paper on top. Roll to thin, rectangle shape. Remove top wax paper. Spread on peanut butter to cover surface and edges. Log roll the dough. Cover with wax paper (you can use the bottom sheet). Chill for 3-4 hours. Remove wax paper and cut into 1/2 inch pinwheels.  
 These are rich and quite yummy. I store mine in a cookie tin lined with wax paper and in between layers.

 Discovered a delicious way to make St. Louis style pork spareribs. 
 I covered a large baking pan with aluminum foil.  I cut the rack in two pieces to make it easier to handle. I used McCormick Grill Mates Barbecue seasoning on both sides and baked uncovered in the oven at 350* for 2 hours. We then put them on the hot grill and smothered them with Kraft Original Barbecue sauce on both sides. Flipping them often until they had the right amount of crisp for our taste. They are so yummy.  
 Enjoy

 Mulberry Cobbler 
 You will need; 
2 cups of mulberries 
½ cup of sugar 
6 tablespoons of butter 
¾ cup of flour 
2 teaspoons of baking powder 
½ teaspoon of salt 
¾ cup of milk 
 Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Wash the berries being gentle to not mash them. 
Next mix the berries with the sugar, (tip: put berries and sugar into a bowl with a lid and gently shake until berries are coated with the sugar) after the fruit and sugar is thoroughly mixed set it off to the side (do not add berries and sugar until the end) 
Melt the butter and pour it into an eight inch square glass dish. Then set this dish aside. 
 Now in a separate bowl mix all of the dry ingredients together (flour, baking powder and salt) and then add the milk to the dry ingredients; once you have mixed this batter, pour over top of butter, do NOT Stir. 
Now that the batter is in the pan you add your mulberries. Sprinkle them all over the top of the batter, do NOT stir.  
 Bake this dish for about 30 minutes. 
You will know it is done when a knife comes out clean of batter when it is inserted in the middle of the cobbler.

 Oh how I love to find new tips and tricks for adjusting recipes to be gluten free and dairy free. At  http://nogluten-noproblem.com/2014/07/cherry-coconut-cream-tart.html  I learned that if you put a can of full-fat coconut milk in to the refrigerator overnight you are able to get coconut cream out of it by opening the BOTTOM of the can and pouring off the liquid. The possibilities for applying this to other recipes are endless. I’ve got some experimenting to do with cream pies, cake fillings and maybe even a pumpkin cheesecake.

 I know that it is an old thread,  but I just found this community a few days ago and already found a lot of helpful information for myself. Thanks to everyone who shared favorite recipes. I can’t say that I’m a good cooker, but you gave me so many ideas to try to cook something new, that I want to start right now. Thanks a lot.

 My partner is making creepy sounds in the midnight while I am in deep sleep. I usually get frightened and jump out of the bed in the middle of the night hearing this huge noise. He has got bruxism and refuses to get treatment for the same. 
It has not bothered me until last year. We are getting older and my sleep patterns have changed. I get only a little sleep now and I find it very difficult to manage the household job and the office works. I feel exhausted during the day time and I feel sleepy during the work hours. 
I tried using earplugs. But, I hate the idea of not being able to hear anything. When I discussed my concern with my best friend, she  recommended purchasing custom mouthguards from Mississauga . She told that it is an excellent method to prevent grinding of the teeth. My husband has got a really small mouth. Is it required to trim the mouthguard before fitting it? Is it possible to clean the mouthguard?  
"

 Hi Saniya, 
 My youngest daughter started grinding her teeth as a teenager. It was loud enough that I could hear the grinding from my bedroom that was across the hall from her’s. I took her to see her dentist and he recommended a custom fit mouth guard. By custom fit I mean they took impressions of her mouth and then the mouth guard was made to fit perfectly over her teeth. She did not have any issues with it because it was a perfect replica of her teeth and it was thin, not big and bulky like you think of when you think of the type used for sports.  
 It was also very easy to clean, she used regular toothpaste to clean it. During the day she had a special case that she kept it in. 
 I hope this was helpful

 Hi all.  
 Did you try kinesiology tape? My ex also got bruxism, I can understand how it’s bothering you at night. He was going to the gym and sometimes got issues with knees. So he was using kinesiology tape to reduce pain in the knee joint.  His coach advised him to try put this tape on zygomatic joints at night to relax muscle pressure. And you know, after few months of using this tape he stopped making creepy sounds at night. Maybe it will help you too.

 Greetings everyone, 
 Has anyone out there tried eating foods that purport to lessen inflammation or pain? How have they worked for you? I have found several websites devoted to this and am going to go on a regimen of following a few of these. I may even start a blog with giving the results of how this works out for me. Let me know if you are interested. 
 Ciao’

 Hi, 
 I had a rheumatologist once tell me about what she called the, “Mediterranean diet” because of my Rheumatoid Arthritis. 
She said to eat foods like fish, fruits, vegetables, whole grains and use olive oil and that these foods help lower inflammation and can help us have less joint pain and morning stiffness. I have never strictly followed this diet but I also have never really noticed any food that has helped lowering my inflammation. 
It will be interesting to see how it works for you. 
 Take care

 Clinical observations of patients with chronic pain who require opioid treatment support the scientific research and the adverse effects of pain and opioids on the endocrine–nutrition systems.1-9 In order to evaluate a patient’s nutritional status, I use a 72-hour “Food and Drink Recall Diary” form with new patients with chronic pain (see Table 3). Over the 3-day period just prior to admission, new patients almost always report a gross deficiency of protein intake. Protein foods, defined here as food with more than 50% protein by weight, such as fish, beef, poultry, lamb, eggs, or cottage cheese, are rarely eaten. Green vegetables such as beans, broccoli, or brussels sprouts, which contain about 30% protein, also are conspicuously absent from their diet. About the only protein some patients ingest is milk.

 I’ve been avoiding ‘night shade family’ vegetables (bell peppers, eggplant, tomatoes, potatoes, etc.) and now find that when I do eat them I get more fatigue and moving around becomes noticeably painful. 
 It is a reminder to stick to my salads, steamed broccoli and lean protein sources like beans, fish and poultry. 
 Managing my own diet is like running a science experiment for an N of 1.

 I have been noticing that my child always sits very close to the TV or computer screen. I thought it was his curiosity which makes him sitting too close to the TV. I used to blame him that sitting too close to the TV makes you blind and all, but he always sits so imminently to the TV. Once I had noticed that he is squinting to see a friend across the street and when I ask him about this, I get to know that he has a focus problem. He sees things clearly up close, but objects in the distance are blurry to him. In school, he has trouble seeing the blackboard and has difficulty playing sports. It may be because of this he always sits so imminently to the TV. When I consulted the doctor, it had diagnosed that he has some focus problem. He said that the childhood focus problem easily treated by eyeglasses. But it makes him distress to carry the glasses on his nose all the time. I have heard about the  centres for laser vision correction in Toronto  that will eliminate the need for everyday contact lenses and glasses. But can kids have laser surgery? Is there an age limit for eye laser surgery? Can someone help me with sharing your thoughts on it?

 I have been dealing with pain for over 20 years. It can consume your life before you really even know it is happening. Over the years the one big thing that I have learned is that finding a purpose, finding a way to distract you from the pain and to help you feel accomplished can make all the difference. Find what makes you happy, find something that you have a passion for. It can make all the difference.

 So true Noki4…I had a fortune oookie years ago that said when all else fails lower your standards.  Sometimes one of the road blocks is remembering what we could do not what we can do. So being able to do less when is in fact more considering is an attitude that works for me; if that makes sense.

 One day at a time. That is what we have to learn and sometimes that is a hard lesson to learn but like you said, sometimes less is more. Accept what you can do and move forward with it is my motto.

 Hey, I’m working in a private firm in Oakville. By the end of next month, I will get transferred to one our branch in Boston. I’m living with my parents now, and my father  got injured in car accident from Mississauga  last week. He has serious injuries, and by God’s grace, he is getting fine now. But it’s difficult for me to leave them here alone in this situation. I’m their only son, so I don’t have any help in taking care of them. One of my friends suggested approaching home health care services to get someone to live in and to take care of my father. So someway mom can get relief, and I can go fearlessly for my job. I did a little research on such firms and found some excellent firms. Before calling them, I would like to hear from you. If you have any experience with such services, please let me know. Any help is highly appreciated.

1/2 cup raisins  
 Preheat oven to 425 degrees F 
place flour, salt and baking soda in a mixing bowl and stir together, fold in buttermilk cinnamon and raisins. 
Turn dough onto a well floured work surface and roll around to lose stickiness. Place dough on greased pan  or lay on parchment paper on baking sheet and form the dough into a round. Score an X on the top to allow steam to escape, bake for 17 to 20 mins. Remove from pan and let cool on wire rack. Omit the raisins and cinnamon and place in a loaf pan for plain sourdough bread.
