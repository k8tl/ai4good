 I have myalgic encephalomyelitis, POTS, cluster headaches, interstitial cystitis, fibromyalgia and more. I used to take pain medications such as oxycodone and tramadol which I became addicted to and had to come off. I now use cannabis oil for pain, anxiety and depression and it works amazingly. There is a lack of information on this on forums. This stuff is a miracle cure. If you are in pain and don’t know where to turn to and have an open mind, this is what you should try.

 I need to change my workspace to address my pain but haven’t requested an accommodation before. Anyone willing to share stories for how this went for you? Does anyone have tips for working with a doctor to get a note? My doc doesn’t seem to understand that I can work laying down from a computer, which is what I do at home. He seems to think that being in an office means either sitting or standing and doesn’t seem to get other designs. But there are over the bed desks and other options. Any advice or stories to share?

 Hey there, 
 I’m the mom of a seven months old baby boy. I’m glad that my baby is healthy and very enthusiastic. I’m here to get advice on back pain after pregnancy. Is it normal to have this after pregnancy? Even though I have back pain after my delivery, it became severe after three months. It’s my first baby, and I’m confused, thinking of the treatment. My friend suggested going for massage therapy. Her friend had consulted a  massage therapy treatment clinic in Thornhill , and her pain got cured. 
 I have no much idea regarding it. Is it suitable to go for massage therapy at the time of breastfeeding? I have fixed an appointment with the clinic by the end of next week. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Share your suggestions. 
 Thanks!

 Backache is a common symptom of mid-to-late pregnancy. Part of the pregnancy backache is caused by stresses and muscles and ligaments in your back. A mixture of causes: 
The extra weight you’re carrying. 
The changed way of standing and walking (your posture). 
The softening of the ligaments around your back can cause things to pass somewhat more freely than average. 
It’s very little you can do to fix the whole thing before your baby is born. The standard remedies for back pain are reduced during breastfeeding. Staying mobile would help, though, and you can talk to your therapist or midwife for advice. 
How do I deal with backache in pregnancy? 
The following methods may help: 
Light workout-a fast stroll and exercise like yoga. 
Avoid sitting or standing for long periods. 
Avoid heavy lifting, like, if you can help, toddlers who tend to be taken away! 
If you’re going to have to lie down, hold your lower back with a pillow. 
Try telling your doctor to recommend you to a physiotherapist for guidance on easy workouts. 
Try to work out in the water. 
Taking warm baths and basic analgesics such as paracetamol can help ask your doctor or midwife for advice. 
 Pain O Soma Consumption During Pregnancy & Breastfeeding 
 It is not advised to consume any medication without doctor’s prescriptions. Yet  Pain O Soma  can be consumed by pregnant women if the baby is underweight or has any possible risk to the unborn baby only after the doctor’s suggestions. 
 Whereas while breastfeeding a child consuming pain o soma may lead to slight sedation to the baby especially if the baby was exposed during pregnancy to lactation.

 Pregnancy back pain usually occurs where the pelvis crosses the spine at the sacroiliac joint. 
There are several potential explanations for why this is going to happen. Here are some of the most likely causes: 
 weight gain.  Women typically receive between 25 and 35 pounds during successful pregnancy. The spine must bear the weight. This can cause lower back pain. The infant’s growing importance and the uterus also pressure the pelvis’s blood vessels and nerves and the back. 
 Posture changes.  Your pregnancy changes your centre of gravity. Consequently, you can gradually—even without noticing—begin to change your stance and the way you walk. This can lead to back pain or pressure. 
 Changes of hormones.  During labour, the body produces a relaxin hormone that helps the ligaments in the pelvic region relax, and the joints loosen in preparation for the birth process. The same hormone can cause ligaments that support the spine to reduce, leading to instability and pain. 
 Muscle separation.  As the uterus expands, two parallel muscle sheets (the rectal abdominal muscles) run from the rib cage to the pubic bone can split along the centre seam. This separation could make back pain worse. 
 Stress.  Emotional discomfort can induce muscle strain in the back, which can be felt as back pain or back spasm. You may find that you have a rise in back pain during the traumatic time of your pregnancy. 
 Some medication.  It is not advisable to take  tramadol when you are pregnant  as it will harm the maturing baby. Further, the side effects will continue for the babies after birth as well. Consuming tramadol can increase the risk of having early delivery and low weight. Additionally, having it will labour will increase the chance of a baby with withdrawal symptoms. After birth, the mother would produce less breast milk, which may be insufficient for the mother. 
 So, if you require such medications, you have to consult with the doctor. When you are trying to get pregnant, breastfeeding, or pregnant, it is better to inform the doctor in advance. This will make them alter the changes in the quantity or any other alternates for the issues. However, remember that not all the body is the same and responds to various medications on various bases. So, it is advisable to seek assistance from your doctor concerning the health condition and have it.

 Hello, 
I hope everyone is safe at their home Since I have been suffering from the lower back for the last couple of years. The problem has been rising so fast for the last couple of weeks; Whenever I walk long, I got pain in my back, and also, whenever I sleep long due to lock downtime, it’s even worse. I tried a lot in the past few days, like doing exercise and therapy even did yoga, but the result remains the same. The last time when I have consulted a doctor and take an X-ray, he told me to have a  muscle relaxer  in for lower back. What should I do now? After this, any suggestions and help, really be thankful for that. 
Thanks,

 A couple of years ago, I took  prescribed Tramadol  for severe back pain.  I couldn’t sleep! Tramadol has been working for me very well. My mood seemed mildly high, and I felt no discomfort. I definitely haven’t been high. I have felt slightly better. It’s been fantastic. Then I chose to quit, and the cold turkey was going to go. It’s been an error. I wasn’t able to relax and be horrified. Edvard Munch had the appearance of “The Scream.” Tears streamed my cheeks. I cried for stupid TV dramas. I had a strong, frozen fear feeling. It’s been terrible. But I could take it OK until it dawned upon me that it happened. Don’t go cold turkey! Don’t go cold turkey!

 Tramadol does not have any malicious intent to get you ‘hooked’ or ‘addicted.’ 
 As for not knowing the possibilities of what might happen – there are only two people you can blame, one – your doctor for not giving you some essential facts, and two – yourself for not researching your  tramadol online prescription . 
 Even on the NHS, doctors should take more time to spell out the expected effects and be addictive, but I understand that they don’t usually have the time. This isn’t going to change anytime soon, though, so… 
 There is a plethora of information online on any prescription drug, and it will tell you everything you need to know before you take it. Some websites, like drugs.com, even have an Interactions Checker which you can input all your medications into and check if they will react badly. It’s very cool, and I even could bring a sour mix up to my doctor, who was able to clarify that the short amount of time I was taking the new drug would be ok with my regular prescription. 
———————————————————————- 
Tramadol is a synthetic (artificial) opiate. It does not mix well with natural opiates such as co-codamol, as one complained about in this forum. Always check with your doctor if you feel uncomfortable, and always take prescriptions as advised. If you start mixing things up and not understanding the chemistry behind it, what do you expect? 
 COMMON SIDE EFFECTS: Constipation; diarrhoea; dizziness; drowsiness; dry mouth; headache; increased sweating; indigestion; mild itching; nausea; trouble sleeping; vomiting; weakness. Constipation seems to be the most common and would advise a gentle laxative. 
 If you have any SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS (see following), then go to A&E or visit the doctor the next day depending on how bad it is, stop taking the Tramadol until you can get medical advice: Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue; unusual hoarseness); burning, numbness, or tingling; chest pain; confusion; difficult or painful urination; disorientation; excessive sweating; fainting; fast or irregular heartbeat; fever; hallucinations; loss of coordination; mood or mental changes (e.g., depression, agitation); red, blistered, swollen, or peeling skin; seizures; severe dizziness or light-headedness; severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea; severe or persistent headache; slow or shallow breathing; suicidal thoughts or behaviours; tremor; vision problems; wheezing. 
 I DON’T WANT TO BECOME ADDICTED: Well, most people don’t. If your condition is temporary, then consider asking for Codeine (a natural opiate) which doesn’t work as well but will help relieve some of the pain. Always take paracetamol when you take any opiate. My NHS doctors have always told me this, saying that they both work better together than just the opiate alone, and in my experience, this is true. When you feel the pain is minimal to moderate, try taking just paracetamol and skipping a dose of your opiate when possible. Once you do this more often than not, you can either realize that you can live with minimal pain or only take the opiate sporadically as needed. 
 If you have a long term condition like me, then I’ll tell you what my doctor in the U.S. told me when I told her I didn’t want to become addicted. First, she said, you’re only an addict if you’re taking the drug to get high; otherwise, you’re just dependent. Then she told me I could either take the medication to alleviate the pain and get some everyday things done daily or don’t take it and live with a pain that will most likely prevent me from leaving my bed and become agitated and irritated with everything and everyone because of my relentless pain. She said there is no shame in becoming dependent and that when the time came to a stop, there would be a safe period of weaning the drug and a plan for the withdrawal. I added that most NHS doctors are ambivalent towards things like this and then demand it. I did, and I was helped; no NHS doctor ever judged me for being dependent, and it does seem like they deal with this often. They are not as organized as in the U.S., where you can get a ‘kick pack’ containing valium, supplements, and many useful tips. Still, my NHS doctor did prescribe me valium for 4 days which was enough to get over the hump,’ and I researched and procured the other supplements and tips I needed online. 
 WHY YOU BECOME DEPENDENT: In plain speak, Tramadol does the job of making your body feel good and does it so well that it relieves the overabundant amount of pain you’re going through because of your medical condition. Once your body realizes it doesn’t have to do this job anymore, it will stop. That’s when your body has become dependent.’ When you stop taking the Tramadol, and your body hasn’t yet taken its ‘job’ back, you feel withdrawal symptoms because nothing makes you feel good. The withdrawal will end once your body takes back its regular job of releasing the chemicals which make you feel good. 
 HOW TO OVERCOME THE WITHDRAWAL PERIOD: If you have become dependent on Tramadol and you most likely have if you’ve been taking it for a long time, it’s almost always best to consult with your doctor about a withdrawal plan. They can help give you a plan to wean the drug and be there when you need muscle relaxers if you need them once you stop the medication. If they are not helpful, see another doctor, rinse and repeat (especially if you’re on NHS!). 
 Even better – What you can do is research all this on the internet, but I will include this one link because I felt it was the one who helped me the most when I went through it. Not just the info but the people who commented and gave support. Many forums will do the same thing, find one which has active, supportive members (and a plan you feel comfortable with), and promise you will feel better about getting feedback from people who have supposed what you are going through. Actually, I’m going to link the process I used for withdrawal, it’s from the same site, and you can explore that further if you want or just Google ‘opiate withdrawal forum’ for support and plans.

 So, I’m a dancer since ever, not professional but I just love it, and lately, my hips are aching badly. At first, I thought it could be piriformis syndrome as I suffered from it after my second child was born, but it’s not as the pain source is a lot closer to the illia crest and less to the piriformis area, which got me thinking of my muscles around the hip/pelvis movement – any ideas there? Like all of a sudden, my right leg feels shorter and stiff.

 Hey folks, 
I’m new in this forum. I’m 26 years old and currently running my own business. A couple of weeks ago, I had a pain on my right molar. It was not much bothering me. I took a painkiller, and it went down. I used to do this whenever I was in pain. But now it has been a couple of days; the pain is getting worse. The pain can not be stopped with painkillers. I tried many other things to get rid of the pain but to no avail. 
I was reluctant to see a dentist because of my fear of dental procedures. But there was no other way but to see a dentist. As my friend’s suggestion, I  consulted a dentist  two days before, and I was delighted with the dentist’s care. 
He prescribed me antibiotics to reduce the infection and, after that, a root canal. 
Friends, I’m pretty worried about the root canal. Will there be any pain for this procedure? Is it possible for me to take regular food after the root canal? Share your experiences on this. I’m eagerly waiting. 
Thanks.

 You can do the following to relieve a toothache temporarily : 
 Cold saltwater rinse. Saltwater can loosen waste between the teeth, act as a disinfectant and decrease inflammation. Rinse your mouth vigorously and add 1⁄2 teaspoon of salt into a bottle of warm water. 
 Rinse of buttocks with hydrogen. A 3 per cent solution of hydrogen peroxide helps reduce inflammation and pain. Dilute the hydrogen peroxide and rinse thoroughly, with equal parts of water. Don’t swallow that. Don’t swallow that. 
 Compress cold. Cold. Keep a cold compress or ice covered in a towel for 20-minute intervals in the sore region for swelling and discomfort. Replay a couple of hours.

 I am sooo glad I found this website and would be very greatful for any suggestions. What can I do? I am a 61 yo female on SSDI. I have severe lumbar spinal stenosis, scoliosis, anterolisthesis, Osteoarthritis, herniated/bulging discs, severe thecal sac compression, spondylosis, and epidural lipomas in my spinal cord. Needless to say, I live with chronic pain. The only thing that allows me some quality of life is the 8mg of Dilaudid the pain management clinic prescribes for me every month. Like all chronic pain patients know it doesn’t relieve the pain but takes enough of the edge off to allow me to do some daily activities. I have been on this dosage, stable and responsible for almost 3 years. 
 Ever since opioids made national news the clinic has been threatening me and other patients with a reduction in our medication dosage. I have been told verbatim that it has to look like I’m trying other things to relieve my pain and that they’re not just giving me pills. I have tried many other things including physical therapy, the clinic’s “cocktail” spinal injections, spinal epidurals and nerve blocks none of which have worked. Now, once again I am being coerced into procedures that do not work or lose my medication! 
 And since I won my Social Security Disability case my insurance has changed to Medicare so that aside from the fact none of these works and is extremely painful when administered, physical therapy will now cost me $40 per session and the injections $350 each in co-pays. I simply cannot afford these co-pays but if I don’t they will reduce my medication! I have tried a lesser dosage and was reduced to tears constantly having to stay in bed because of the severe pain. They say Do No Harm. But denying me the medication that allows me some quality of life IS doing harm. My primary care physician won’t touch this issue and trying to find a different pain management doctor results in the same thing because of the federal government. I also do not want to make them mad at me and they refuse to treat me at all. Please help! What can I do?

 Yes, I have had severe back pain. I have tried many things to at least ease the pain. Nothing worked. Then a friend asked me to try CBD oil. My friend gave me a link to get some free samples to try out. I clicked the link got the samples and in about a little over an hour I could feel the pain ease away. I believe you can experience similar results. Here is the link given to me

 Hi Vicki, 
I too have many of the same back issues /surgery you had. I despise Pain Mgt doctors…they treat most of us like we are drug seekers or selling it or whatever. I have been to 3 diff ones in past and it was I who ended their “treatment” of me. 
My regular doc has been supplying me now with my pain meds for quite some time…yet he is feeling the pinch from his superiors and may on next refill say no….I dont know. 
This is a travesty to ALL CHRONIC PATIENTS IN THE USA!….and there are soo many if us…they cannot just throw us away….ER depts would be so overwhelmed if they do shut us down. There is no more Compassion from MANY PAIN TYPE DOCS ANYMORE. We must neve give up, I too what to keep the quality of life I have.

 Vicki, 
You need to report your Dr to Medicare. Or at the very least tell your Dr that you are going to report them for billing Medicare for useless procedures. They will get in more trouble for that, then they would giving you your prescription without other treatment.  I had a Dr in AL do the same thing, so I reported him and changed Drs. This becomes tricky because you don’t what a “trouble maker” stigma when it comes to pain management Drs, however if you explain to another Dr what your current Dr is doing, they may be willing to take you on right away. Good luck to you!

 Hi, I’m in the same position. I have Arachnoiditis and most Dr’s have no idea what that is. All they want me to do is more injections and other procedures including more surgeries.  
 I’ve had my first surgery in 1999 for a laminectomy and the second in 2000 was for installing rods and screws where the disc was removed. Pain just kept getting worse. Then came the injections. Those did absolutely nothing and may have caused my Arachnoiditis. I’m told they may have pierced my spinal cord.  
 So now 18 years of being on pain meds. Most have been prescribed in those years by my primary care physician but for some reason with the health system I go to, my PCP keep disappearing. They either get fired, change profession, quit or whatever and I get a new one. Each time I go thru hoops to continue my meds. This time the new one wants nothing to do with my meds. He sent me to a Pain Management Dr. and they want me to go thru more injections.

 My husband has chronic headpain all the time,from a concussion and  an invasive nasal surgery.He spends the whole day in bed. I’m furious with the govt, and the doctors. They just won’t help you if you have chronic pain.My husband has been suffering for 16 yrs. Doctors only put him through some ridiculous treatments the do nothing.I can’t tell you how many things he has tried!!He ven had electrodes and wires implanted in the back of his head.  He did have one dr that allowed him to have a small amount of Norco BUT only if he paid 1500 every 3 months for a useless Botox treatment.botox never helped his head pain but the dr made us pay 1500 every 3 months anyway.we couldn’t afford it and we told him it didn’t work but it made no difference, so we had to stop seeing him. Why is it you are allowed to kill yourself at the end of life and allowed to kill your baby at 9 months but if you have chronic debilitating pain you CANT have a pain pill?I thought doctors were supposed to help people.Nope all they do is put you on all the latest new drugs that don’t do shit and they have side effects! Narcotics take my husbands pain away but nope you can’t have it.Dont patients have rights to be out of pain? We need a lawyer to sue the government to give us our right to pain relief.

 Very sad times! People with chronic pain have to either deal with it, use illegal drugs or suicide… Pain is destroying us! We need help NOW!!! Every month I get stressed when my meds are done and I need refills. The stress alone is killing me. I suffer from migraines and they get worse every month when it’s time for refills.

 I had LASIK done almost a decade ago, it worked very well. Recently my sight weakened due to natural course of ageing. I did a lot of research, saved money and went to a small clinic with high tech, expertise and track record. To this day, they claim a 100% success rate, so extensive are their testing/preparation procedures. Now their price is a little higher than what I paid years back. Most places and people say that my closer vision will be compromised. Has anyone done this and feel like it was still worth it.

 I had abdominal surgery few months ago. I had gallbladder and part of colon removed laproscopically. Things were going good for a few months until I started getting pain at one of the small incision sites when I was walking fast. Rest would help and I would be fine. It was getting worse and worse and I almost went to ER a few times since it felt like the incision was going to explode. 
 Had CT which didn’t see any issues and if I take it easy pain is minimized. Problem is my life is not the same at all with the amount of taking it easy I have to do.  
 Anyone ever have anything similar? Not sure what to do. Surgeon said we could give it a month or two of this taking it easy and if it doesn’t work we could use block for nerves, cut nerve (both those options would make it so I wouldn’t know if there was a issue there in future). Could also go back in with camera and look around and cut scar tissue if that’s causing issue but again that could cause more scarring. Or I could go to pain clinic. 
No clue what to do but limiting my activity to this level for the rest of my life isn’t an option. Any suggestions?

 Hey, 
I had pretty lousy astigmatism from the early years of my life. Back then, I was studying in Moscow, so I got my Lasik done in a famous eye hospital. That was maybe about 24 years back. Now I’m 44. Presently I’m experiencing dryness, so I consulted a doctor, he told me about dry eye syndrome, which is common after LASIK due to decreased tear production. So he recommended using lubricating eye drops or other solutions to assist with dry eye symptoms. But he also said I might have to go for another  laser eye surgery  due to my high refractive error. I’m nervous about undergoing surgery, so I need your experiences and suggestions.

 I have myalgic encephalomyelitis, POTS, cluster headaches, interstitial cystitis, fibromyalgia and more. I used to take pain medications such as oxycodone and tramadol which I became addicted to and had to come off. I now use cannabis oil for pain, anxiety and depression and it works amazingly. There is a lack of information on this on forums. This stuff is a miracle cure. If you are in pain and don’t know where to turn to and have an open mind, this is what you should try.

 I need to change my workspace to address my pain but haven’t requested an accommodation before. Anyone willing to share stories for how this went for you? Does anyone have tips for working with a doctor to get a note? My doc doesn’t seem to understand that I can work laying down from a computer, which is what I do at home. He seems to think that being in an office means either sitting or standing and doesn’t seem to get other designs. But there are over the bed desks and other options. Any advice or stories to share?

 Hey there, 
 I’m the mom of a seven months old baby boy. I’m glad that my baby is healthy and very enthusiastic. I’m here to get advice on back pain after pregnancy. Is it normal to have this after pregnancy? Even though I have back pain after my delivery, it became severe after three months. It’s my first baby, and I’m confused, thinking of the treatment. My friend suggested going for massage therapy. Her friend had consulted a  massage therapy treatment clinic in Thornhill , and her pain got cured. 
 I have no much idea regarding it. Is it suitable to go for massage therapy at the time of breastfeeding? I have fixed an appointment with the clinic by the end of next week. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Share your suggestions. 
 Thanks!

 Backache is a common symptom of mid-to-late pregnancy. Part of the pregnancy backache is caused by stresses and muscles and ligaments in your back. A mixture of causes: 
The extra weight you’re carrying. 
The changed way of standing and walking (your posture). 
The softening of the ligaments around your back can cause things to pass somewhat more freely than average. 
It’s very little you can do to fix the whole thing before your baby is born. The standard remedies for back pain are reduced during breastfeeding. Staying mobile would help, though, and you can talk to your therapist or midwife for advice. 
How do I deal with backache in pregnancy? 
The following methods may help: 
Light workout-a fast stroll and exercise like yoga. 
Avoid sitting or standing for long periods. 
Avoid heavy lifting, like, if you can help, toddlers who tend to be taken away! 
If you’re going to have to lie down, hold your lower back with a pillow. 
Try telling your doctor to recommend you to a physiotherapist for guidance on easy workouts. 
Try to work out in the water. 
Taking warm baths and basic analgesics such as paracetamol can help ask your doctor or midwife for advice. 
 Pain O Soma Consumption During Pregnancy & Breastfeeding 
 It is not advised to consume any medication without doctor’s prescriptions. Yet  Pain O Soma  can be consumed by pregnant women if the baby is underweight or has any possible risk to the unborn baby only after the doctor’s suggestions. 
 Whereas while breastfeeding a child consuming pain o soma may lead to slight sedation to the baby especially if the baby was exposed during pregnancy to lactation.

 Pregnancy back pain usually occurs where the pelvis crosses the spine at the sacroiliac joint. 
There are several potential explanations for why this is going to happen. Here are some of the most likely causes: 
 weight gain.  Women typically receive between 25 and 35 pounds during successful pregnancy. The spine must bear the weight. This can cause lower back pain. The infant’s growing importance and the uterus also pressure the pelvis’s blood vessels and nerves and the back. 
 Posture changes.  Your pregnancy changes your centre of gravity. Consequently, you can gradually—even without noticing—begin to change your stance and the way you walk. This can lead to back pain or pressure. 
 Changes of hormones.  During labour, the body produces a relaxin hormone that helps the ligaments in the pelvic region relax, and the joints loosen in preparation for the birth process. The same hormone can cause ligaments that support the spine to reduce, leading to instability and pain. 
 Muscle separation.  As the uterus expands, two parallel muscle sheets (the rectal abdominal muscles) run from the rib cage to the pubic bone can split along the centre seam. This separation could make back pain worse. 
 Stress.  Emotional discomfort can induce muscle strain in the back, which can be felt as back pain or back spasm. You may find that you have a rise in back pain during the traumatic time of your pregnancy. 
 Some medication.  It is not advisable to take  tramadol when you are pregnant  as it will harm the maturing baby. Further, the side effects will continue for the babies after birth as well. Consuming tramadol can increase the risk of having early delivery and low weight. Additionally, having it will labour will increase the chance of a baby with withdrawal symptoms. After birth, the mother would produce less breast milk, which may be insufficient for the mother. 
 So, if you require such medications, you have to consult with the doctor. When you are trying to get pregnant, breastfeeding, or pregnant, it is better to inform the doctor in advance. This will make them alter the changes in the quantity or any other alternates for the issues. However, remember that not all the body is the same and responds to various medications on various bases. So, it is advisable to seek assistance from your doctor concerning the health condition and have it.

 Hello, 
I hope everyone is safe at their home Since I have been suffering from the lower back for the last couple of years. The problem has been rising so fast for the last couple of weeks; Whenever I walk long, I got pain in my back, and also, whenever I sleep long due to lock downtime, it’s even worse. I tried a lot in the past few days, like doing exercise and therapy even did yoga, but the result remains the same. The last time when I have consulted a doctor and take an X-ray, he told me to have a  muscle relaxer  in for lower back. What should I do now? After this, any suggestions and help, really be thankful for that. 
Thanks,

 A couple of years ago, I took  prescribed Tramadol  for severe back pain.  I couldn’t sleep! Tramadol has been working for me very well. My mood seemed mildly high, and I felt no discomfort. I definitely haven’t been high. I have felt slightly better. It’s been fantastic. Then I chose to quit, and the cold turkey was going to go. It’s been an error. I wasn’t able to relax and be horrified. Edvard Munch had the appearance of “The Scream.” Tears streamed my cheeks. I cried for stupid TV dramas. I had a strong, frozen fear feeling. It’s been terrible. But I could take it OK until it dawned upon me that it happened. Don’t go cold turkey! Don’t go cold turkey!

 Tramadol does not have any malicious intent to get you ‘hooked’ or ‘addicted.’ 
 As for not knowing the possibilities of what might happen – there are only two people you can blame, one – your doctor for not giving you some essential facts, and two – yourself for not researching your  tramadol online prescription . 
 Even on the NHS, doctors should take more time to spell out the expected effects and be addictive, but I understand that they don’t usually have the time. This isn’t going to change anytime soon, though, so… 
 There is a plethora of information online on any prescription drug, and it will tell you everything you need to know before you take it. Some websites, like drugs.com, even have an Interactions Checker which you can input all your medications into and check if they will react badly. It’s very cool, and I even could bring a sour mix up to my doctor, who was able to clarify that the short amount of time I was taking the new drug would be ok with my regular prescription. 
———————————————————————- 
Tramadol is a synthetic (artificial) opiate. It does not mix well with natural opiates such as co-codamol, as one complained about in this forum. Always check with your doctor if you feel uncomfortable, and always take prescriptions as advised. If you start mixing things up and not understanding the chemistry behind it, what do you expect? 
 COMMON SIDE EFFECTS: Constipation; diarrhoea; dizziness; drowsiness; dry mouth; headache; increased sweating; indigestion; mild itching; nausea; trouble sleeping; vomiting; weakness. Constipation seems to be the most common and would advise a gentle laxative. 
 If you have any SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS (see following), then go to A&E or visit the doctor the next day depending on how bad it is, stop taking the Tramadol until you can get medical advice: Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue; unusual hoarseness); burning, numbness, or tingling; chest pain; confusion; difficult or painful urination; disorientation; excessive sweating; fainting; fast or irregular heartbeat; fever; hallucinations; loss of coordination; mood or mental changes (e.g., depression, agitation); red, blistered, swollen, or peeling skin; seizures; severe dizziness or light-headedness; severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea; severe or persistent headache; slow or shallow breathing; suicidal thoughts or behaviours; tremor; vision problems; wheezing. 
 I DON’T WANT TO BECOME ADDICTED: Well, most people don’t. If your condition is temporary, then consider asking for Codeine (a natural opiate) which doesn’t work as well but will help relieve some of the pain. Always take paracetamol when you take any opiate. My NHS doctors have always told me this, saying that they both work better together than just the opiate alone, and in my experience, this is true. When you feel the pain is minimal to moderate, try taking just paracetamol and skipping a dose of your opiate when possible. Once you do this more often than not, you can either realize that you can live with minimal pain or only take the opiate sporadically as needed. 
 If you have a long term condition like me, then I’ll tell you what my doctor in the U.S. told me when I told her I didn’t want to become addicted. First, she said, you’re only an addict if you’re taking the drug to get high; otherwise, you’re just dependent. Then she told me I could either take the medication to alleviate the pain and get some everyday things done daily or don’t take it and live with a pain that will most likely prevent me from leaving my bed and become agitated and irritated with everything and everyone because of my relentless pain. She said there is no shame in becoming dependent and that when the time came to a stop, there would be a safe period of weaning the drug and a plan for the withdrawal. I added that most NHS doctors are ambivalent towards things like this and then demand it. I did, and I was helped; no NHS doctor ever judged me for being dependent, and it does seem like they deal with this often. They are not as organized as in the U.S., where you can get a ‘kick pack’ containing valium, supplements, and many useful tips. Still, my NHS doctor did prescribe me valium for 4 days which was enough to get over the hump,’ and I researched and procured the other supplements and tips I needed online. 
 WHY YOU BECOME DEPENDENT: In plain speak, Tramadol does the job of making your body feel good and does it so well that it relieves the overabundant amount of pain you’re going through because of your medical condition. Once your body realizes it doesn’t have to do this job anymore, it will stop. That’s when your body has become dependent.’ When you stop taking the Tramadol, and your body hasn’t yet taken its ‘job’ back, you feel withdrawal symptoms because nothing makes you feel good. The withdrawal will end once your body takes back its regular job of releasing the chemicals which make you feel good. 
 HOW TO OVERCOME THE WITHDRAWAL PERIOD: If you have become dependent on Tramadol and you most likely have if you’ve been taking it for a long time, it’s almost always best to consult with your doctor about a withdrawal plan. They can help give you a plan to wean the drug and be there when you need muscle relaxers if you need them once you stop the medication. If they are not helpful, see another doctor, rinse and repeat (especially if you’re on NHS!). 
 Even better – What you can do is research all this on the internet, but I will include this one link because I felt it was the one who helped me the most when I went through it. Not just the info but the people who commented and gave support. Many forums will do the same thing, find one which has active, supportive members (and a plan you feel comfortable with), and promise you will feel better about getting feedback from people who have supposed what you are going through. Actually, I’m going to link the process I used for withdrawal, it’s from the same site, and you can explore that further if you want or just Google ‘opiate withdrawal forum’ for support and plans.

 So, I’m a dancer since ever, not professional but I just love it, and lately, my hips are aching badly. At first, I thought it could be piriformis syndrome as I suffered from it after my second child was born, but it’s not as the pain source is a lot closer to the illia crest and less to the piriformis area, which got me thinking of my muscles around the hip/pelvis movement – any ideas there? Like all of a sudden, my right leg feels shorter and stiff.

 Hey folks, 
I’m new in this forum. I’m 26 years old and currently running my own business. A couple of weeks ago, I had a pain on my right molar. It was not much bothering me. I took a painkiller, and it went down. I used to do this whenever I was in pain. But now it has been a couple of days; the pain is getting worse. The pain can not be stopped with painkillers. I tried many other things to get rid of the pain but to no avail. 
I was reluctant to see a dentist because of my fear of dental procedures. But there was no other way but to see a dentist. As my friend’s suggestion, I  consulted a dentist  two days before, and I was delighted with the dentist’s care. 
He prescribed me antibiotics to reduce the infection and, after that, a root canal. 
Friends, I’m pretty worried about the root canal. Will there be any pain for this procedure? Is it possible for me to take regular food after the root canal? Share your experiences on this. I’m eagerly waiting. 
Thanks.

 You can do the following to relieve a toothache temporarily : 
 Cold saltwater rinse. Saltwater can loosen waste between the teeth, act as a disinfectant and decrease inflammation. Rinse your mouth vigorously and add 1⁄2 teaspoon of salt into a bottle of warm water. 
 Rinse of buttocks with hydrogen. A 3 per cent solution of hydrogen peroxide helps reduce inflammation and pain. Dilute the hydrogen peroxide and rinse thoroughly, with equal parts of water. Don’t swallow that. Don’t swallow that. 
 Compress cold. Cold. Keep a cold compress or ice covered in a towel for 20-minute intervals in the sore region for swelling and discomfort. Replay a couple of hours.

 I am sooo glad I found this website and would be very greatful for any suggestions. What can I do? I am a 61 yo female on SSDI. I have severe lumbar spinal stenosis, scoliosis, anterolisthesis, Osteoarthritis, herniated/bulging discs, severe thecal sac compression, spondylosis, and epidural lipomas in my spinal cord. Needless to say, I live with chronic pain. The only thing that allows me some quality of life is the 8mg of Dilaudid the pain management clinic prescribes for me every month. Like all chronic pain patients know it doesn’t relieve the pain but takes enough of the edge off to allow me to do some daily activities. I have been on this dosage, stable and responsible for almost 3 years. 
 Ever since opioids made national news the clinic has been threatening me and other patients with a reduction in our medication dosage. I have been told verbatim that it has to look like I’m trying other things to relieve my pain and that they’re not just giving me pills. I have tried many other things including physical therapy, the clinic’s “cocktail” spinal injections, spinal epidurals and nerve blocks none of which have worked. Now, once again I am being coerced into procedures that do not work or lose my medication! 
 And since I won my Social Security Disability case my insurance has changed to Medicare so that aside from the fact none of these works and is extremely painful when administered, physical therapy will now cost me $40 per session and the injections $350 each in co-pays. I simply cannot afford these co-pays but if I don’t they will reduce my medication! I have tried a lesser dosage and was reduced to tears constantly having to stay in bed because of the severe pain. They say Do No Harm. But denying me the medication that allows me some quality of life IS doing harm. My primary care physician won’t touch this issue and trying to find a different pain management doctor results in the same thing because of the federal government. I also do not want to make them mad at me and they refuse to treat me at all. Please help! What can I do?

 Yes, I have had severe back pain. I have tried many things to at least ease the pain. Nothing worked. Then a friend asked me to try CBD oil. My friend gave me a link to get some free samples to try out. I clicked the link got the samples and in about a little over an hour I could feel the pain ease away. I believe you can experience similar results. Here is the link given to me

 Click on that link above to get your samples. This stuff really works.

 Hi Vicki, 
I too have many of the same back issues /surgery you had. I despise Pain Mgt doctors…they treat most of us like we are drug seekers or selling it or whatever. I have been to 3 diff ones in past and it was I who ended their “treatment” of me. 
My regular doc has been supplying me now with my pain meds for quite some time…yet he is feeling the pinch from his superiors and may on next refill say no….I dont know. 
This is a travesty to ALL CHRONIC PATIENTS IN THE USA!….and there are soo many if us…they cannot just throw us away….ER depts would be so overwhelmed if they do shut us down. There is no more Compassion from MANY PAIN TYPE DOCS ANYMORE. We must neve give up, I too what to keep the quality of life I have.

 Vicki, 
You need to report your Dr to Medicare. Or at the very least tell your Dr that you are going to report them for billing Medicare for useless procedures. They will get in more trouble for that, then they would giving you your prescription without other treatment.  I had a Dr in AL do the same thing, so I reported him and changed Drs. This becomes tricky because you don’t what a “trouble maker” stigma when it comes to pain management Drs, however if you explain to another Dr what your current Dr is doing, they may be willing to take you on right away. Good luck to you!

 Hi, I’m in the same position. I have Arachnoiditis and most Dr’s have no idea what that is. All they want me to do is more injections and other procedures including more surgeries.  
 I’ve had my first surgery in 1999 for a laminectomy and the second in 2000 was for installing rods and screws where the disc was removed. Pain just kept getting worse. Then came the injections. Those did absolutely nothing and may have caused my Arachnoiditis. I’m told they may have pierced my spinal cord.  
 So now 18 years of being on pain meds. Most have been prescribed in those years by my primary care physician but for some reason with the health system I go to, my PCP keep disappearing. They either get fired, change profession, quit or whatever and I get a new one. Each time I go thru hoops to continue my meds. This time the new one wants nothing to do with my meds. He sent me to a Pain Management Dr. and they want me to go thru more injections.

 My husband has chronic headpain all the time,from a concussion and  an invasive nasal surgery.He spends the whole day in bed. I’m furious with the govt, and the doctors. They just won’t help you if you have chronic pain.My husband has been suffering for 16 yrs. Doctors only put him through some ridiculous treatments the do nothing.I can’t tell you how many things he has tried!!He ven had electrodes and wires implanted in the back of his head.  He did have one dr that allowed him to have a small amount of Norco BUT only if he paid 1500 every 3 months for a useless Botox treatment.botox never helped his head pain but the dr made us pay 1500 every 3 months anyway.we couldn’t afford it and we told him it didn’t work but it made no difference, so we had to stop seeing him. Why is it you are allowed to kill yourself at the end of life and allowed to kill your baby at 9 months but if you have chronic debilitating pain you CANT have a pain pill?I thought doctors were supposed to help people.Nope all they do is put you on all the latest new drugs that don’t do shit and they have side effects! Narcotics take my husbands pain away but nope you can’t have it.Dont patients have rights to be out of pain? We need a lawyer to sue the government to give us our right to pain relief.

 Very sad times! People with chronic pain have to either deal with it, use illegal drugs or suicide… Pain is destroying us! We need help NOW!!! Every month I get stressed when my meds are done and I need refills. The stress alone is killing me. I suffer from migraines and they get worse every month when it’s time for refills.

 I had LASIK done almost a decade ago, it worked very well. Recently my sight weakened due to natural course of ageing. I did a lot of research, saved money and went to a small clinic with high tech, expertise and track record. To this day, they claim a 100% success rate, so extensive are their testing/preparation procedures. Now their price is a little higher than what I paid years back. Most places and people say that my closer vision will be compromised. Has anyone done this and feel like it was still worth it.

 I had abdominal surgery few months ago. I had gallbladder and part of colon removed laproscopically. Things were going good for a few months until I started getting pain at one of the small incision sites when I was walking fast. Rest would help and I would be fine. It was getting worse and worse and I almost went to ER a few times since it felt like the incision was going to explode. 
 Had CT which didn’t see any issues and if I take it easy pain is minimized. Problem is my life is not the same at all with the amount of taking it easy I have to do.  
 Anyone ever have anything similar? Not sure what to do. Surgeon said we could give it a month or two of this taking it easy and if it doesn’t work we could use block for nerves, cut nerve (both those options would make it so I wouldn’t know if there was a issue there in future). Could also go back in with camera and look around and cut scar tissue if that’s causing issue but again that could cause more scarring. Or I could go to pain clinic. 
No clue what to do but limiting my activity to this level for the rest of my life isn’t an option. Any suggestions?

 Hey, 
I had pretty lousy astigmatism from the early years of my life. Back then, I was studying in Moscow, so I got my Lasik done in a famous eye hospital. That was maybe about 24 years back. Now I’m 44. Presently I’m experiencing dryness, so I consulted a doctor, he told me about dry eye syndrome, which is common after LASIK due to decreased tear production. So he recommended using lubricating eye drops or other solutions to assist with dry eye symptoms. But he also said I might have to go for another  laser eye surgery  due to my high refractive error. I’m nervous about undergoing surgery, so I need your experiences and suggestions.
