 My dad was suffering from chest pain for several months. He was facing a lot of troubles during his sleep. He was unable to breathe properly. When he tries to breathe in, during his sleep, he was feeling a pain in his chest. So we decided to take him for an overall medical check-up. We booked an appointment with the doctor in a nearby hospital and took him there the next day. The doctor examined him thoroughly. When the check-up got over, the doctor told us that he is suffering from sleep apnea condition. He advised my dad to  wear a cpap mask  while sleeping. So we bought it for him, and he started wearing it. There was a good improvement in his condition after several days, and he was able to get rid of his troubles. We were also very thankful to the doctor for suggesting the right solution for my dad. Is there anyone who has used a cpap mask before for your breathing issues? Do tell us your experience too.

 My father had similar issues but it was because of the blocks he had in his arteries. I’ve read somewhere CPAP masks can cause pneumonia for sleep apnea sufferers. If the mask is not maintained well there are chances for bronchitis as well. Pls do get a second opinion.

 Hey, anyone tried cranial osteopathy to treat early symptoms of  Parkinson’s syndrome? 
I have an evil back pain and body posture issues due to the same. 
I was having allopathy meds and where I met this guy who is on the second stage of Parkinson’s. He suggested me this  clinic of cranial osteopathy  in Toronto, from where he got reduced his pain and discomforts of the first stage pd. 
Last week I had a session, after the detailed examination he said my three vertebrae are out of place. The doc stretched my neck area with an optimal pressure, it was hell kind of pain at the last click, surprisingly I felt much relieved and even started to feel better even after the first session! 
Also, he found there is some weak pulse to my brain. I just forget my every other distress when I get relieved from the bad neck pain. 
I wasn’t expecting anything from this treatment, but now I have become pretty interested about what change cranial osteopath going to reflect on the rest of me! 
The main thing I got impressed about the doc was he is not ready to promise anything yet doing his best. I’m not expecting anything, but I’m going to give a try by attending the coming sittings. 
Before that, I want to know if anyone on this board had a similar experience and went for cranial treatment? Please let me know if it was satisfying or not??

 I’m a relatively young man suffering from post-axial polydactyly at the age of 32.  I have an extra digit on my right hand that causes me pain.  My last two digits on my right hand share the same bone so I guess that has to account for my pain.  I tried to go to a specialist at Duke University back in 2009 and that didn’t go well.  They couldn’t figure out what’s causing me pain.  I’ve tried virtually everything from pain killers to exercise and nothing seems to work.  Currently, I can’t afford to have surgery so that’s out of the question.  Anybody that can offer me any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you and have a pleasant day.

 Neuromuscular Neck Pain is a crippling life limiting difficult problem to resolve. The absolute worst thing a person can do is opioid medication. At first the medication can give some relief, then after a short while the increased pain your feeling is coming from the medication. After many years the medication work less and there is nowhere to turn. Surgery is most cases is the 2nd worst choice and only gives temporary relief. Surgery does work for about 10% of a specific type of neck problem. However there are ways to resolve some of these neck problems. 
 If you have helped your neck in any way or have found things that give you relief, please share them with us.

 Hi Brucestevens, 
 It can be a never-ending journey when we are searching for ways to relieve the pain. Have you tried some of the complementary and alternative approaches? 
 We want to invite you to join us for the Outreach Support Conference calls every Tuesday where you can talk to others who are also on a pain journey. You can read more about the calls at,  https://paincommunity.org/tpc-outreach-support-conference-calls/ 
 Take care,

 If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the last 16 years is that everyone is different. I know many people who benefit from opioids for their pain and others for whom it helps very little or not at all. Same goes for surgery and every other treatment out there that I’ve tried. 
 I’ve met very few people who could name just one cause or type of pain. Chronic pain is a complex disease and needs complex treatment. 
 The best advice I can give is to not give up and be open to trying different treatments (not sure I’d include surgery in the list as I don’t know many who have been helped once the pain was chronic) — even trying something that didn’t work before. 
 An example is that early in my journey, my pain was so out of control that when I tried massage it didn’t help. Years later, it’s the thing that got me out of my wheelchair and walking again — but — it wasn’t the only thing that I did. I combined it with other things that helped until I found the right balance that worked for me.

 People who know my story of living with chronic pain since childhood often ask how I cope and how do I keep going. The answer is simple. I learn as much as I can all of the time. I research, ask questions and am always on the lookout for things that give me information about pain, any kind of pain and any kind of pain condition.  
 I’ve found the best ideas for managing chronic health issues when I’ve gone outside of the box. Sure I have EDS (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) and it may seem logical to search out EDS specialists and EDS specific treatments. That is inside of the box thinking. Instead I look to my friends with ALS, MS, cancer, CRPS, or a broken leg to learn about their pain journey and any treatments they find useful.From my grandmother and mother I learned that soaking my feet in a warm epsom salt bath for 20-30 months does more to relieve pain and spasms than most pills. From my friend with ALS, I’ve learned that just thinking about my body’s alignment and making a subtle change (or asking for help to shift) in position will relieve all kinds of pressure/gravity/nerve pain quickly. 
 It has been my own life experience that if I keep up with my exercises and am mindful of my body, I will minimize the number of injuries I have to endure each day. Thus I share with you the information below about physical therapy in the hopes that a presentation like this might give you a new tip, trick or tool to manage your own pain.  
 EDNF is presenting a live webinar with Kathryn Lister, DPT, OCS, CLT, “Intelligent Exercise — How You Can Take Control With EDS” on Wednesday, October 28, 2015, 7:00–9:00pm ET. This webinar is tailored for patients and family members interested in learning more about EDS, but all are welcome. More information is on our website at  http://www.ednf.org/webinars . To participate in the webinar, please reserve your free access code at  https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/regist…/2101321021983955201 .

 I was lucky to be diagnosed at age 13 with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) by a doctor who also had it. Since then I’ve heard of lots of people that weren’t diagnosed until adulthood after their bodies had been damaged by accidental injuries or prescribed treatments gone awry. Connective tissue disorders are complex and I think they are under-diagnosed because the pain, irritation or injury that motivates an individual to seek medical care becomes the sole focus of treatment. I consider myself lucky to have had the early diagnosis for doctors to consider in treating each injury. This got me wondering if other people also feel “lucky” when they get a diagnosis.

 Morning all! This is my first day post surgery. The staff just made their rounds and gave me my directives. Usually they have you up on your feet day of surgery. I of course have to be different and was pretty well out of it due to unforseen difficulties. So day 2 and all they want me to do is tighten my thigh muscle to build strength during commercials. Not sure when I will have a full regimen of pt. They will be taking me off the pump later today and putting me on oxycodone.

 I have been on my feet using a walker and a few more physical torture moves. My pain med went empty during lunch and it took a while to get a nurse in here. She is checking on what they will be doing for pain control. Has been over an hour since I have had anything for pain control. Really starting to feel it. My new roommate has checked in to have his right leg amputated. Hope things go well for him.

 day 3 & I woke up this morning with screaming pain. They gave me Tylenol with hydrocodone. It didn’t even touch the pain so they gave me an injection a few minutes ago and that is taking the edge off the pain. I hope it will put me out of pain soon. Should be doing more pt later. Still not sure when they will let me out of here.

 Marinesargeant please, please write a letter to the facility addressed to the floor manager, the vice-president of nursing, and the CEO and tell them of your negative pain experience.  We (in pain management) KNOW poorly treated post-operative pain can become chronic post operative pain. There is a cascading effect as well; when your pain is too severe you cannot perform in physical therapy as well as if your pain was low.  I hope things have improved.  Also I will mention just because these nurses aren’t too knowledgeable about pain and pain management, I hope they are doing a bowel program as well; an ounce of prevention.
