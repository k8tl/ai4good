 I thought I would point out some places that give veterans a discount 365 days a year. With most veterans out there barely scrapping by, I figured that this would help üôÇ Here are some links that will help you out:

 If any vet knows of other places that give discounts, please add to the list.

 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration believes a mobile app could help people with terrifying nightmares. 
 The federal agency has approved the NightWare system as a form of treatment for PTSD patients. 
NightWare is only available for Apple Watches. 
 It allows clinicians to monitor patients who suffer from traumatic nightmares, which have been linked with higher rates of suicide. 
 The app vibrates when it perceives that the patient is in the middle of a nightmare. 
 According to the company, NightWare ‚Äúis a wearable technology that learns the wearer‚Äôs sleep patterns and customizes a treatment for each individual, interrupting nightmares so sufferers can get a good night‚Äôs sleep.‚Äù 
 The company explains: ‚ÄúAn intervention (smartwatch alert vibration) at nightmare stress threshold is designed to arouse but not awaken the wearer‚Äîpreserving the night‚Äôs rest.‚Äù 
 NightWare can only be downloaded with a prescription.

 I am curious if any other veteran has had opiates taken away from them. Were you tapered off or was it more drastic? If you have, what other treatment options are they offering you? I ask these questions because the VA will start my tapering off of morphine for the next 6 months. I saw my PCP last month and he didn‚Äôt have a clue as to what the VA will do for pain. I brought up the IMPACT program and he then remembered that he had undergone some training in that and had accupuncture done several times a week and it helped him with his back pain. But what they will do with me is still an unknown issue. I am planning on contacting the Patient Advocate to see if they can find out anything for me. I will write about my journey in hopes that some of my fellow vets will find something they can use that will help them out. Good luck.

 Whow, nobody answer this. I know it‚Äôs been a year but have you found help? I am a disabled Veteran. VA has not helped me with my pain. I have to go outside to get pain management and medicine. I take Morphin & Oxycodone. I am not sure I would be alive without them. Dorn VA Medical center in SC don‚Äôt give out too many pain medications. Even if I have years of doctors and specialist notes. Let me know if you have found a better way to there hearts.  
 I hope this website works better. To wait a year. Shame

 I haven‚Äôt experienced this thankfully. It‚Äôs the General Practictioner‚Äôs I feel like I have to have a good relationship with as I have a pain specialist that justifies what level of medication I‚Äôm on. I have had one Dr day I won‚Äôt be prescribing these meds anymore just before my wedding and honeymoon. I was very anxious but luckily found a new GP but now he‚Äôs on medical leave and I‚Äôm looking for a Dr that is willing to prescribe the meds I need. I feel like I‚Äôm going around conducting interviews lol

 I am currently going through a local spine clinic and getting oxycodone rx‚Äôd to me. It saddens me that the suicide rate has climbed through the roof here in the state that I live in. So many veterans have been unable to gain relief from there pain and have decided to ‚Äù check out ‚Äú. I can empathize with that so am glad that I have found some relief from the pain. All I can say is that my thoughts are with them and I hope that they can find some relief and not take their lives.

 I am a 70 year old Vietnam combat veteran.the veterans administration put me on hydrocodone 15 years ago for severe back pain and bursitis in my hips. about a year ago I went to see my primary care physician at the veterans administration was told that there was no more prescriptions for hydrocodone to be given. I could take morphine if I wanted to. I chose to take the morphine and took it for quite a few months. However, did not work for me did not make me feel very good. I had stomach problems xcetera. So I decided to wean myself off of the morphine and let me tell you it was no picnic. I was sick for about a week but finally got off of the morphine. Now what? I started seeing a pain specialist outside of the VA and he started giving me cortisone shots in my back and in my hips. I get them as needed now. I take baclofen which is a muscle relaxant and I use ice and heat. I also use ibuprofen as needed. I have good days bad days and some very bad days. It is a struggle that I deal with everyday and sometimes it gets me down. That‚Äôs my story I wish you all the best.

 Hello all, I‚Äôve been on pain meds for many years for several ailments and started using the VA in 2015 and the PCM I was assigned established all of my prescriptions including my pain meds. Last month went I requested a refill online through secure messaging my new provider (this is my 4th) told me that that the VA no longer offers narcotic or opioid chronic pain management and a taper is mandated. Now my main issue with this is I‚Äôve never met and or have I ever been examined by the ARNP that I‚Äôm assigned to, we have no medical doctor at my facility. According to numerous articles and literature on VA websites the following must occur: prior to any changes in therapy a caregiver needs to discuss the risks of continued use along with possible benefits. Additionally there needs to be an established plan to consider dose reduction and to consult with specialists, or to consider alternative pain management strategies when considering an opioid taper. A physician needs to monitor conditions that may warrant additional evaluation and arrange follow-up care when indicated. The caregiver needs to ensure that screening and treatment is offered for conditions that can complicate pain management before initiating opioid taper since numerous factors go into the speed of taper selected, suggests only 5 to 20% every 4 weeks depending on dose, duration and any risk factors of medical conditions. Now my dose was cut by 66%, from 84 tablets to 28 tablets. I have been communicating thru the secure messaging and the clinic has responded with letters. My issue is what the hell am I suppose to do? The clinic refuses to make me an appointment to discuss this and said I can only make one for my annual‚Ä¶all the correspondence ends with I can seek an out of the VA provider who would accede to my wishes‚Ä¶My wish is that I didn‚Äôt have so much pain that I cry several times a week, I can‚Äôt sleep because the pain wakes me up and I‚Äôve been getting by with a very low dosage, along with ibuprofen, joint gel, heat and ice. What can we do???

 Hello Susan, I am in the same boat unfortunately. We can thank the president for a lot of it. It depends on what state you are in, well for outside Help I mean, VA is about the same in the US. I take Morphine and Oxycodone, but I have to go outside the VA to a pain specialist. I am living in fear each month hoping and praying that the medications are not taken away from me. VA just mainly says the pain is in my thought, some psychological medications is all they will give. It plays with you mind and I find I am confused and still in pain. I am not sleeping much, but the can‚Äôt give me medications for that. It is a sad and miserable life. I really don‚Äôt think I can live without help. I am a believer in God, so suicide is not Godly. But man pain never goes away. VA is trying to be the cold hearted SOB. I am sorry I have not been much help. I just needed to vent. I hope you understand. Right now the option are better outside of VA. Good luck and keep your head up. Let us all know it you find anything. We‚Äôll do the same.

 Thank you Tyron for sharing and I know how hard it is and I‚Äôm really afraid when I get those last 28 pills next week.  I have pain on top of pain if you know what I mean and pain is real, it‚Äôs not a figment of our imagination. I‚Äôm having back injections in the morning so I haven‚Äôt been allowed to take ibuprofen (which I use with my pain meds) for the week prior to, so hopefully I‚Äôll get a little relief. You know my mom has lots of pain, many medical issues and I have thought in the past that she takes lots of meds and it should help, but now I know it doesn‚Äôt take it away, it can numb some of it though. I‚Äôm waiting until after my procedure to change over from TRICARE Prime to US Family Health Plan and maybe I can find a doctor to listen. I had great health care and a great doctor before I got laid off, so know I rely on TRICARE and the VA and its really frustrating. I understand about not sleeping, I might fall asleep, but in a few hours I‚Äôm up, I use my heating pad 24/7, started drinking tea and usually fall back to sleep in a bad position and then I hurt even more. I‚Äôm going to contact the Patient Advocate for my area and let them know what happened, that my provider who I‚Äôve never seen made a decision without considering my physical or mental health, or lack of. I‚Äôll keep you posted. Good luck to you and remember that each of us is worth it, we matter and if you ever get low, make a phone call, reach out to a friend, or post here and I‚Äôll respond. I‚Äôm still trying to figure this site out, bear with me, but know that you have me in your corner.

 Sorry That I haven‚Äôt gotten back to anyone sooner. I have been off of pain meds for 1 1/2 years now, not by choice. Mine must have been one of the first VA‚Äôs to start this new policy. They also have switched to the mind over matter  policy. The VA has tried several methods with me over the years to alleviate my chronic pain. Hypnotherapy, biofeedback, etc. None of them worked and I have a high tolerance to pain meds. I had been going outside the system to a spine specialist for pain meds, but was dropped from that place due to my missing a couple of appointments. I have had to learn to live with the pain because of my high tolerance and now lack of any sort of pain med. My spine is deteriorating due to bulging and herniated discs. I am currently going to physical therapy 1 x per week to ‚Äù strengthening my core ‚Äù Haven‚Äôt noticed improvements but will continue to make the 2-3 hour round trip and see if it will help. Not holding up much hope because I had something pop in my back 2 weeks ago that laid me out flat for a week. I am thinking one of the bulging discs herniated in my lumbar but won‚Äôt know til my next round of MRI‚Äôs. Will keep updating and let you know if I notice any improvements.

 Any one that is a disabled veteran knows how hard it is to get your proper rating of disability with the VA. I received my package from VARO Saturday stating that they were finally approving my appeal. I started this process back in 2007 and my case made its way from the VARO to the US Court of Veteran Appeals 2 times and was on its way for the third time when the Board of Veteran appeals finally agreed that they hadn‚Äôt rated me properly. 9 years I battled with the VA till I received my rating of 90% scheduler. I have been Individually Unemployable since 2010. I know that I could have made the process a lot easier if I had followed the advice posted on a couple of websites. vawatchdog.org or hadit.com. These are both websites created by veterans to help their fellow vets with a lot of the problems you may run into with the VA and how to make your appeal go a lot smoother and hopefully you won‚Äôt have to wait 9 years to win your appeal. No matter what, do not give up! You may get frustrated, and even angry but if you stay strong you will get there.

 Here is a link to the Defense & Veterans Center for Integrative Pain Management. It is an excellent model that isn‚Äôt widely available in the civilian healthcare systems. Maybe this will be so successful that civilian systems will be clamoring to offer Integrative care as a matter of course.

 I guess none of this has been implemented as yet at the VA I use as of yet. Wish I was not so skeptical, but to me this is just another feel good, we are doing something for the vets like Veterans Choice. That has been one SNAFU after another and still no sign that they will get Veterans Choice running like they say it will. Reading this now is the first time I have ever heard of the DVCIPM. If I hadn‚Äôt read about this in your post FF, who knows when I would have heard of this. That is a systemic problem with the VA!!! 99.99% of the veterans have no idea what is available to them because the VA does not bother or want to educate the veterans as to what is available to them. The different parts of the VA itself do not understand what is what because of the lack of education that the staff receives as to how the programs should work. I found this out during my last go round with Veterans Choice. I knew more about VC than my va clinic did. It leads to a lot of confusion and ultimately frustration for the veterans in these programs when nothing gets done.

 Several months ago I met another former Marine while taking the Disabled American Vets van to an appointment at the VA. He kind of latched onto me and we talked and texted back and forth on a regular basis. One day, he called to ask if by chance I could come and pick him up close to another city 30 miles from here. My wife and I did and while heading back towards Heber Springs with him, he broke down and let us know he was homeless. I looked over at my wife and she nodded so I said that we have a spare bed and he could stay while we got things worked out for him. I started hitting google to see what I could find. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the VA is actually working on getting homeless vets off the street. They will not only take the veteran in and give them a roof and food, they will ensure that they get the medical help that they need. This includes psychological help. They will help the veteran find a job and even vouchers for housing through HUD in the community of their choice. They will also train the veteran to help them get a good paying job. 
   The only problem with this program, as with most of the benefits, is that the VA is not getting the message out. Us veterans don‚Äôt even know a tenth of the benefits we receive as veterans. 
   What my final point of this ramble is that if you see someone on the street, say hi to them. Find out if they are veterans and let them know about this program. Even if they are not veterans, they are people. All they may need to get going again is to know that we care. And not put them on a bus to another town or state so that the local government can say that they have no homeless program. Take the time and see if there are any programs or groups that will help the homeless out and direct them to that. I was within a hairs breathe of being homeless myself several years back.

 Great post sgt! Here is the link to the program and you can also download posters, brochures, etc. to put up around your town to help the homeless veterans. 
 http://www.va.gov/homeless/ 
 There are approximately 130,000 to 200,000 homeless veterans every night according to the National Coalition for the Homeless:  http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/veterans.html . The VA intends to end the homeless veteran problem by the end of the year. We shall see and hope for the best.

 How is he doing now, Sarg? It makes me sad how our Vets put their lives on the line for us and we thank them by ignoring their needs & struggles when they return. This is a civil society??? Well, at least they are not treated disgracefully as the Vietnam Vets were treated. Sigh as I smh.

 Follow up on the story of the homeless veteran we were attempting to help. Saturday Afternoon I lay down to take a nap. Woke up to some movement in the room and without my glasses couldn‚Äôt make out a figure going into the master bathroom. Both the vet and my wife have dark curly hair. I lay there watching the bathroom door to see who it was. I heard a crash and got out of bed and went to the bathroom. The vet was lying on the floor with a bottle of my wife‚Äôs meds in his hands and he was still attempting to open them. I went off on him DI style and told him to pack his trash and get out of my house. He had stolen most of my wife‚Äôs xanax either Saturday or Friday plus we had a jar with 1 dollar bills in the room we were saving to take our gk‚Äôs to Disneyworld. I figure that he took at least $50. I am very disillusioned and my wife and I have decided that our charity will only extend to beings that appreciate what you do for them and give love instead of take from us. By this I mean dogs and cats. This has been a big blow to me and my faith in my fellow vets‚Ä¶.

 That really makes me sad to hear. He really blew his chance to turn his life around. It makes you think that he wanted to get caught‚Äìmaking that attempt while you were home and napping. What an invasion of privacy you must be feeling, knowing that you entrusted him into the safety of your home and he paid you back by rummaging through your home looking for drugs and money. I suppose he never went into treatment as you had taken the time to arrange for him? I guess the desire to escape his demons overrode the desire to get clean and sober. How do you help someone find meaning in their life again, if they are not willing to work for it. SIGH. Maybe someday in the future, he will find you and apologize for the harm he caused as he works his steps towards rehabilitation‚Äîmy wish for both of you.

 MarineSgt,  
 It makes my heart hurt that you and your wife had this to happen. You took this young man in to your home and truly wanted to help him get a fresh start and the monster of drug abuse had a tight grip on this young man and he could not break free. 
It is so sad that he was being given a chance to change his life for the better and he totally threw it away. I hope that this young man will find the help he needs to beat the monster and you know if he does, part of it will be because you and your wife took him in and tried to give him another chance at life. 
 Please know that you did everything right for this young man. The monster was stronger than his will to stop the abuse of drugs. I will continue hope that one day he finds the strength to let it go. 
 Take care, 
Noki4

 Sorry that I am late with this information. I am going to post a link to the VA government page that will let you all know what the rates are. 
 http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/rates-index.asp 
 As you can see, the 1.7 % gave us a nice bump üôÇ The page also has several other links for other compensation that you can receive. ( it also shows the esoteric way that the VA uses to give you your disability rate ) 
 Hope this helps!

 Greetings to all my fellow veterans, 
    It is my pleasure to take on the task as moderator for this forum. I see that marinesargeant 
has already made several worthwhile posts to this board. I will continue to add to this and hope that he will also keep on with adding his thoughts to this. I hope that more veterans will join in with questions, answers and insight to this board and that it will grow and become a place that all veterans can come to in order to find answers that they need.

  Did you serve at Camp Lejeune North Carolina from June of 1957 to March of 1987? If so, you need to check out  http://www.tftptf.com . During this time, the water wells were contaminated on base and at base housing. The chemicals that were in the wells are listed on this site as well as the damage and symptoms that can affect you. My friends wife died because of cancer and their son has MS. Most likely due to the chemicals in these wells. Semper Fi!

  Life as a disabled veteran can be hard, especially if you are not sure how to apply for your benefits or raising the percentage that you are now receiving. I have found a few sites that can help you through the process: 
 1)  http://www.vawatchdog.org  ‚Äì covers the process of filing your claim, tracking your claim and appealing. Plus a whole lot more! 
 2)  http://www.hadit.com  another great site to help you. 
 I am sure that there are other sites that will lead you to the benefits that you‚Äôve earned by your service.
