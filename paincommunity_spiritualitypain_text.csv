 I feel that we each find our own spirituality and how we deal with our pain. It may not be the same as others but that is ok. We are each so unique in how the pain affects our lives in whole.

 I used to enjoy going to church to be with the people. The sense of community and seeing familiar faces. Thinking back on it I believe that the pews were too uncomfortable to sit there for a full hour. Sometimes I would leave because the church was so full and nobody would give up their seat for this person with an invisible disability. 
 I feel now that my spirit is supported and strengthened by the quiet moments of reflection, the love of friends and family and the ability to get out to marvel at the nature around me. 
 I will accompany friends or family to their place of worship occasionally now. Easier when they are with me to help me to take care. True community in action, right?

 I grew up going to church and for many years after I left home I continued to go. I moved to another state and for many different reasons stopped attending church on Sundays. With that being said, I do feel that my spirit is fulfilled in a different way now. I still have all the beliefs I held as a child growing up in church the only difference is how I take care of those beliefs and fulfill my need for spirituality.

 December and January is that time of year when people of many different faiths celebrate. So many opportunities to join groups in houses of worship. I just want to say that it is okay to go and okay to skip. Just make sure your physical comfort/support is addressed to keep your pain managed while pursuing your spiritual needs of community and fellowship. 
 In addition Christian Christmas and Jewish Hanukkah, there are Shinto, Sikh, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist holidays in the first couple of weeks of January. The Baha’i faith celebrates World Religion Day January 17, 2016. 
 A great resource for tracking holidays is  http://www.interfaithcalendar.org/2016.htm

 For some, meditation is spiritual. For others it is a tool to bring focus. 
 I find that meditation gives me a chance to slow down and clear my mind. Afterwards I’m able to appreciate the connections I have to other people, nature and the world. I think of it as a spiritual connection because it is an intangible that I believe really exists. 
 Do you meditate? Do you pray? Someone recently told me that meditation and prayer are the same thing so I’ve been thinking more about the similarities and differenced between the two practices for me. For me I think they are different. Meditation clears the path. Prayer for me is like a compass for the journey.

 I really enjoyed the first webinar in the Healing Art Program and found the exercise of coloring the manual to be very meditative. 
 Has anyone else experienced this?

 I have tried meditation and confess I am not good at it. Difficult to clear my mind. Need more practice. 
Prayer is my comfort.

 txgal1960, I also have a hard time with meditation. My mind never seems to allow me to slow down long enough to grasp the good that meditation can be. I have had good results using things as a distraction and mentally healing for my pain. I am enjoying the Healing Arts Experience that The Pain Community has launched.

 Meditation comes in many shapes and sizes. Some forms of meditation that are not labeled as traditional “meditation” like prayer, singing, writing, or just being present in a moment. Like that moment of looking into the eyes of a beloved pet as you stroke them gently and feel a solid connection of just the two of you for that moment in time.

 Maggie, I absolutely agree with you

 While browsing through the list of natural ways to deal with back pain, I came across an article that says laughter yoga can also help with this pain. 
I don’t even know there was something called laughter yoga. But if you know something like this, can you please tell me more about its effectiveness.

 Hi Alpha Mode, 
 This is something that I have not heard much about. I will look into it and see what research that I can come with and get back to you as soon as possible. 
 Take care,

 Hi Alpha Mode, 
 I don’t know about the yoga piece of your question, but laughter definitely helps me. I can be having a terrible day and I force myself to go to my ladies group. We laugh, we cry, we support and encourage each other. During that hour, I forget about the pain for a while and the laughter especially helps me feel better–at least for a while. 
 It’s obviously not permanent, but it provides some temporary relief — and my spirits are lifted as well.

 Laughter definitely helps me to deal with pain. Sometimes when I’m doing yoga I look around an laugh at how much different I seem to be moving than some of the others around me despite decades of doing yoga. I’ve never been to a laughter yoga class. I should add it to the list of things to be on the look out for near my home.

 Laughter definitely helps with pain, there are many examples of scientific research, and yoga helps to be aware and control your body.

 Hello experts, 
 Good day to all! I have been suffering from severe pain. And now looking for a natural supplement. I started searching already on Google or other search engines. And found few vendors. Though one of my neighbors has told me to try for maeng da. How is this one? Does anyone try this maeng da yet? I also got few websites which sell  maeng da . Please let me know if you have another source.  
 Thank you so much!

 I’ve not tried maeng da. I do use essential oils and CBD oil.  I have gotten off all narcotics using them.
