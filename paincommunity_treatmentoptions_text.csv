 Hi all, just hoping to get some feedback from members of this pain forum. Do you think a non-invasive nerve blocking device (application is similar to a heating pad) could contribute to your current pain treatments? Do you think a non-invasive device would be a sufficient replacement for a prescription pain medication or invasive device?

 I’m looking for advice on some home devices for pain treatment. I’ve heard and read about some, but two of them got my attention, solio alfa plus and tens. Any insights? thanks

 10xPURE™- GOLD CBDa 
MUSCLE & JOINT RELIEF CREAM 
 Our 10xPURE™ patented delivery oil supports the delivery to the targeted area with CBD, CBDa, Emu oil, Menthol and Camphor for fast relief. 
 CBDa is the mother of CBD. CBDa is raw, pure and free of solvents, combustion and toxic residue, and when processed, especially at high heat, converts to CBD, and destroys most or all the CBDa. Think of it as harvesting fresh vegetables from your back yard and cooking them at high heat—-something good is always lost. 
 Early CBDa research suggests it could deliver potent relief by selectively inhibiting an enzyme in our bodies called COX-2. COX-2 is an enzyme that triggers when you experience injury. The response is natural. CBDa research suggests that it reduces the production of prostaglandin by blocking the COX-2 enzyme. Less prostaglandin results in less discomfort. 
 The best of both worlds would be a plant-based product/ingredient that blocks COX-2 without blocking COX-1. Research suggests that CBDa does just that. 
 Infused in our 10xPURE™-GOLD cream are selected ingredients to promote EXTRA-STRENGTH RELIEF when applied topically. Emu oil enhances deep penetration and the delivery of other ingredients. Camphor, with its cooling effect, has been shown to promote muscle and joint relief. Menthol can be applied topically and has been shown to support blood flow in the area for healing and relief from discomfort. 
 KEY BENEFITS 
 * Provides EXTRA-STRENGTH RELIEF. 
* Formulated for FAST ABSORPTION.

 Hey everyone! Getting old is tough, eh? I have these occasional muscle cramps and sprain in my back. Sometimes it’s because my workouts or me sitting for long hours as part of work are a problem. Anyway, I used to apply pain balms to get rid of these pains. Though I got a short term redemption from these problems, I was still going through pain. Hence I decided to consult this  physiotherapist near me . The people there were kind and warm. I was provided with satisfying hand-on therapy. They have acupuncture and other vestibular rehabilitation solutions for all kinds of muscle and nerve-related issues. I was given mainly physio and massage therapy sessions. Now I feel a lot better and healthy.

 In addition to age, various risk factors are frequently associated with muscle cramping. 
Generally, muscle cramp rehabilitation may be done by relaxing the muscle, massaging, using a mixture of heat to facilitate muscle relief and ice to help numb any discomfort that could be caused. Stretching helps to lengthen muscle fibers and to make contraction more effective while exercising. 
 A muscle cramp is a rapid, spontaneous contraction of one or more of the muscles. If you’ve ever been woken up in the night or frozen in your tracks by an unexpected charley horse, you know that muscle cramps can cause intense pain. While usually harmless, muscle cramps can make it temporarily difficult to use the affected muscle. 
Long periods of exercise or manual labor, particularly in hot weather, may lead to muscle cramps. Some medicines and certain medical disorders can also induce muscle cramps. You should generally take self-care steps to relieve muscle cramps at home. 
When to see a doctor 
Muscle cramps typically disappear on their own and are only severe enough to warrant medical treatment. However, if you have cramps, see the doctor: 
Trigger considerable discomfort 
Are concerned with swelling of the knee, redness,, or changes in the skin 
Are linked to muscle weakness 
Happening regularly 
May not help with self-care 
Aren’t correlated with a clear trigger, such as strenuous activity. 
 These steps may help prevent cramps: 
Avoid dehydration. Drink lots of water a day. The number depends on what you eat, your sex, your level of exercise, the temperature, your fitness, your age, and the medicine you take. Fluids allow your muscles to contract and relax and keep your muscle cells hydrated and less irritable. Replenish drinks at frequent intervals during operation, and resume drinking water or other fluids once you have stopped. 
Stretch your muscles. Stretch before and after you use some muscle for a longer period of time. If you happen to get leg cramps in the night, stretch until bedtime. Light exercise, such as riding a stationary bike a few minutes before bedtime, can also help avoid cramping when you’re asleep. 
Although instead of showing it to the doctor you can do exercise on your own at home. 
still, if this doesn’t work try  pain medications.

 Hi all 
Hope you are fine 
Last month when I was driving, I lost car control and hit a nearby tree. Most of the car’s front portion gets damaged, and I was hospitalized for two weeks. I reached home two days before, and I’m still suffering from body pain, especially my shoulder pain. I share this issue with my doctor, and he suggested  using shock wave therapy  to get rid of this pain. So I’m planning to search for the treatment detail. Can anyone help me to know more about this treatment? Please share your thoughts and opinions on this. It would be a great help to me. 
Thanks!

 If shockwave therapy doesn’t work to fix your shoulder pain. Do try electrotherapy treatment to get rid of shoulder pain. 
On the off chance that an individual isn’t encountering adequate control of torment and different side effects, electrotherapy—a treatment that guides gentle electrical heartbeats to the issue region—might be an alternative.  
 Electrotherapy incorporates a scope of medications utilizing power to diminish torment, improve the course, fix tissues, reinforce muscles, and advance bone development, prompting enhancements in physical working.  
 While countless individuals discover electrotherapy accommodating, others don’t. The clinical writing on electrotherapy’s adequacy has been blended, and not all electrotherapy medicines are upheld by inquiring about. Electrotherapy gadgets extend in cost from under $30 to several dollars. A few of the more current items are accessible over the counter, offering adaptability for the individuals who can bear the cost of them.

 Hello all. I am dealing with chronic pain due to DDD, herniated discs, scoliosis, and bone spurs in cervical and lumbar spine. The pain, on some days, is quite unbearable. I do not want to go to a pain clinic – are there other options for developing a pain MGMT plan including narcotics as needed? I appreciate any input you have. Thanks so much!

 Hi Seahorse, 
I work at Take Courage Coaching, and I’ve also dealt with pain. For me, their coaching has helped me manage my pain in a way I didn’t think was possible. I was skeptical at first but saw so many testimonials. It has really helped me be able to live my life again and has changed how I see my pain. How has your pain been this month?

 I tried out a TENS unit (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) because of lower back pain and it didn’t work at all for me, I just thought it was annoying. Why doesn’t it help me? What reasons could there be? I really thought it would work so I could stop taking opioids. 
"

 Which  tens units  are you using? I think there has any problem with your tens unit. I’m using TENS 7000 2nd Edition Digital Unit and it works well for me.

"
 I tried Tens…did not help me. Some people it does not or very little relieve pain….we are all respond different to meds, treatments, etc. Find one that will work for you.

 Sadly tens didn’t help me either. Everyone is diff. It sucks.

 I’ve used a couple of TENS units too and they didn’t work. But then my chiropractor recommended me one and seems to really help. Didn’t realize that there are different types of TENS units

 Hey everyone!  I’m hoping someone else has experienced this bc I can’t find anything about this with google searches. I am prescribed 37.5 mcg fentanyl patches to be changed every 2 days. I know they are usually supposed to be changed every 3 days but my doctor has had me change mine every 2 days for about the last 3 years at least. My issue is that I feel like no matter what the patch only seems to last 1 day for me. About halfway during the 2nd day I start experiencing very mild withdrawal symptoms and my pain starts to increase. Has anyone else had this happen?  And if so what did you do about it?  Any recommendations are very appreciated!! Thanks in advance!   
"
"
  My guess is that it’s an issue with tolerance. I was using patches for many years. I started on lower doses (like you’re on now), and increased all the way up to 150 mcg patches. It’s really a normal thing for this to happen with any pain killer (I’ve been on almost everything you can imagine).  What helped me a lot was switching the type of painkillers I was taking, as tolerance develops. Example: From the patches to dilaudid, dilaudid to oxycontin, etc., etc. You really need a doctor that knows equivalencies of all the different pain medications for this to be effective though. I wish you the best. 
 1 other thing: 
I had to switch pharmacies at one point for insurance reasons, I forget the patches I was originally on, but the Duragesic brand was superior to whatever patch I was using originally. They had much better adhesive.

 Hi Ray Ray, 
 I live with ankylosing spondylitis. One thing that my doctor has always insisted on is that I keep as active as I can because it can help with the pain. He is also always reminding me to pay attention to my posture. 
My best to you and I look forward to speaking with you. 
 Take care,

 Hi 
 Thank you for your response , it is really nice to speak to someone with A.S it is not a common thing so finding some one else is always a blessing for me. 
 My Doctor is advising the same, if  i may ask how long have you been living with A.S , what medications do you feel have helped the most. 
 And the flair ups how do you keep them under control, I am struggling with that , the pain is always a given just the level that differs from day to day, my biggest struggle is the flair ups. 
But it is a bit confusing because I have been diagnosed with Fibromaligia as well, so I dont really know when what is acting up only I can feel the pain is building and building then it just hits me out of nowhere . 
 I have been self injecting with Voltaren some times it helps but not always, any tried and tested advise you can give me . 
"

 I was diagnosed about 12 years ago with ankylosing spondylitis. My journey started out with degenerative joint disease and as damage was done through the DJD and osteoarthritis and a few other diseases & conditions I received the ankylosing spondylitis diagnosis.  
 The exercise is what I have found helps the most to ease the pain and help me maintain flexibility and to keep the flairs at bay. Of course there are times no matter what I do the flairs hit. When the flares hit I use heat and ice and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but I have to be careful using the NSAIDS because they can cause stomach issues.  
 For me it is doing whatever I can to keep the inflammation, pain and stiffness to a point I can tolerate it and that is where the ice, heat, and exercise come in to play. I have found soft yoga to be a big key in keeping the stiffness low. 
 Due to my other diseases and conditions I am on several medications but have found Meloxicam (Mobic) to help a great deal. 
 I totally understand about trying to figure out if it the fibro or the ankylosing spondylitis. When you have multiple illness or conditions it makes it hard to know which one is acting up and causing the increase of pain.  
 My best to you, 
Noki4

 Thank you I appreciate it.  I will definitely consider what you are saying I must admit my exercise is not what it should be.  I just hate all these medications I can’t help but thank no sometimes the damage they doing but I guess its the lesser of two evils. 
Best regards thank you for the help I’m still learning to deal with it so I appreciate ur input

 Good Day All , 
 I am having hard time with my feet , they are burning like crazy , I am unable to wear shoes or even sandals , the bottom of my feet burns like crazy , and even a night my feet can not touch each other at all, I sleep with pillows between my knees to separate my legs and feet from touching each other , And they are swollen I can see where my ankles start or stop its just round. I tried doing some research and there is a lot of things that can cause this, but what I am thinking is nerve damage, I know the Ankylosing Spondilytis attack your nerves , But i do not have medical Aid and can not go to hospital because I am unable to stand at all my for 2 seconds before I start feeling unconformable ,I mean I can not even stand in the Que at our local KFC to get lunch , I am worried I might end up in a wheel chair as I dont have the money to see specialist and the still pay for treatment it is concerning I dont know what to do , but funny enough when I am walking I do not feel the pain only when I stop and stand , 
 So what role the A.S and Fibro are playing I dont know , I cant afford any medications except for the Morphine Syrup so I am not under any real treatment either so i dont know what to do . 
 If anyone has any suggestions I would appreciated it , anything is better than nothing.

 I’ve had AS since I was 15. It is a long journey. I struggled with maintaining habits that help my pain and managing my pain for many years. I finally got a coach and am already seeing improvements. I tried many medications, Meloxicam, Humira, and hundreds over the counter, but for me it is really the habits and self-care that helps.

Pain-management coaching is an evidence-based approach to pain recovery that gives the participant real tools and strategies for minimizing the life-crushing impact of chronic pain. Pain-management coaching offers the first ray of hope for many people who have suffered for years and enables those with surgical or acute pain to avoid the pitfalls of chronic pain.

 Hi,  
 I’m currently doing an extended project qualification on ‘the analgesic effects of cannabis’ as im interested in the prospect of cannabis being a bigger part of the medical industry.  
 I have constructured a questionairre to help with ny research. If anyone has or is currently using cannabis-based products, such as CBD oil, to manage their pain and other symptoms could you please fill in my questionairre (link attatched below) – as it would be a great help.  
 Thank you

 Hello, Ress. I have also the same experience as you. What I used to do to eliminate the pain is to stand sometime and have a water break while chatting one of my office mates. It straightened my back for a while.

 Just got a parrot.  Distracting, a delight to keep moving and even more to sing and dance with him.  Laughter is the best medicine.  Lately has been hard enough that it is difficult o concentrate enough to read, let alone get up and dance around.  There are many lovely birds needing homes, as the sanctuaries are full.

 I have Myalgic encephalomyelitis, POTS, cluster headaches, interstitial cystitis, fibromyalgia and more. I used to take pain medications such as oxycodone and tramadol which I became addicted to and had to come off. I now use cannabis oil for pain, anxiety and depression and it works amazingly. There is a lack of information on this on forums. This stuff is a miracle cure. If you are in pain and don’t know where to turn to and have an open mind, this is what you should try.

 A few weeks before, I met with a car accident.  I was travelling to home from my office. Suddenly, I lost control of my car, and it hit a nearby tree. My car got crashed, and I hospitalized with minor injuries. I reached home two days before, and I’m still suffering from body pain, especially on the neck. Before leaving the hospital, I told my doctor about this severe neck pain. He suggested me to approach  clinics providing neck pain treatment in Toronto  to get rid of this pain. So I’m planning to do the same. But before that, I would like to hear from you. What is the best treatment for neck pain? Can neck pain be a sign of something serious? Please share your thoughts and opinions on this. It would be a great help to me.

 Hi martinjoe, 
 I am new to this forum but immediately was drawn to your post. I have chronic neck pain that started with a whiplash injury from a roller coaster in 2007 and was exacerbated by fibromyalgia-which was kicked off by the original whiplash injury. I was diagnosed with retrocollis, a type of tortocollis by the pain specialist, but they’re all soft tissue injuries, which cannot be alleviated surgically. I got in a car wreck as a passenger in an Uber about a year ago, suffered another whiplash injury, and have been on pain meds and doing PT ever since. My current physical therapist is a GODSEND-and that’s coming from a staunch Atheist (or scientist-you choose the label you prefer). I have had over 10 years of chronic neck pain experience and have a lot of ideas for soft-tissue damage injuries. Have you had the full MRIs and X-rays and all and nothing structural is wrong? Let me know what your pain is like, dull or acute, or changing-like alot of neck issues are. Deep Tissue Laser Therapy (Light Force) and Isometric muscle strengthening exercises are my current routine, but I have been through Botox, trigger point injections, epidural injections, they even cauterized some nerve endings (which I did not enjoy and had bad side effects with). Let me know. I’d love to trade ideas. My inability to heal from the 2007 whiplash led me down the road to find the fibromyalgia diagnosis, and treating that helped with the neck pain. Thyroid conditions can also affect certain pain in the neck/back/shoulders. Have you had your thyroid checked regularly/lately? Let’s start a dialogue!
