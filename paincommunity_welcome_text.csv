 Hi, I‚Äôm Trev or Pigz. I‚Äôve decided to join this forum as I‚Äôm hoping to get some help or even just having someone to talk to that knows what I‚Äôm going through. I have probable nerve damage in my back C4 C5 which causes me a great deal of pain and I also get restless legs. I‚Äôve had this condition for 21yrs and every year its getting worse its been really doing my nut in very little sleep, anger issues and deep depression. this has  ruined my life I used to be very active life and soul of the party type, but now I‚Äôm just a miserable old man. All the hobbies i used to enjoy have stopped my wife left me because she couldn‚Äôt handle the mood swings (I couldn‚Äôt blame her). I know there are a lot of people worse off than me but it‚Äôs hard telling myself that when I‚Äôm either in deep depression or in a lot of pain, and I also know this is a common story but I‚Äôm hoping someone might have something new to say, all I get from the docs is Pain Therapy group AGAIN! Any how that‚Äôs my story hope to see people in the forum soon

 Urikar Pro 3 Massage Gun Video Review: 
Speed Test on Coca-cola 
 Urikar released a brand new percussion gun ‚Äì Pro 3 recently. This massage gun uses a high-torque brushless motor equipped with QuietPower‚Ñ¢ 2.0 technology, which quietly delivers up to 45lbs of no-install force at up 3400 rpm and stimulates muscle groups to a depth of 14mm. It quickly relieves muscle tension, promotes circulation, greatly accelerates muscle recovery, and brings deep-level comfort. 
 Also, the most important feature that set Urikar Pro 3 apart from competitors is the 30 speed levels. Pro 3 provides 30 speed levels ranging between 1800-3400rpm. Whether it‚Äôs for muscle relaxation after exercise, or just a gentle daily massage, you‚Äôll find the right speed for you. 
 
 A fresh video shows how the different speed levels of Pro 3 have impact on the coca-cola, the higher speed you use, the greater amplitude formed and the more small bubbles generate. so, you can tell how powerful the massage gun is and the differences between each speed. The Speed 1-6 focuses on muscle activation, Speed 7-12 is mainly for muscle relaxation, while if you want a post-workout relax, I will recommend you to select the Speed 13-18. For fitness enthusiast, just select the professional level, speed 19-24, if you are a professional athletes, then the speed 25-30 is just right for you. 
 This massage gun comes 6 interchangeable massage heads to target all muscle groups. Pro 3 helps you to relax muscle tissues across the whole body in a way that‚Äôs comfortable and effortless. 
 Key Features of Pro 3 
 ‚óè	Deliver 45lbs of no-install force at up 3400 rpm with the latest QuietPower 2.0 technology.

Urikar creates many high-quality massage guns in addition to the Pro 3. The Urikar Pro 2 is another entry in their product line-up, which is for people that want a heated massage gun. Using the 3+1 smart modes, you can choose between  constant speed, intermittent, ladder, and heating modes. You‚Äôll also find the 180¬∞ rotating arm, eight separate attachments, and a 65W brushless motor.

 This is the first time I‚Äôve ever posted on line. I‚Äôm not on Facebook, etc I‚Äôve felt that talking about the chronic pain I‚Äôve had for decades brings focus on it and makes it worse. I‚Äôm 63 & see my life shrinking as a result of it @ it‚Äôs  getting the best of me. Depression worsening. Thx for reading.

 Hi Tiffany, 
 Welcome to The Pain Community. I understand that for some talking about the pain constantly can make life harder to do with. It‚Äôs like you start to sink in the depths of depression and it is hard to fight one‚Äôs way out. It can be helpful to share with others who do truly understand. We can support each other and share what has helped us. 
 Did you know that we have a support conference call every Tuesday if you are in the United States? We talk about life in general, the good, the bad and everything in between. The call is free if you have free long distance. If you would like more info about it, you can read about it at this link,  https://paincommunity.org/tpc-outreach-support-conference-calls/ 
 If I can answer any questions please let me know. 
 Take care,

 I have Fibromyalgia, hemiplegic migraines and essential tremors. I‚Äôm always swollen and in pain and at times my migraines cause stroke like symptoms on my left side. I staterted playing with Cannabis and  making my own oils. Eating with cannaoil or drinks would help but I needed something to rub on my skin due to rashes and swelling, feeling like body was on fire.. so I went to dispensery and bout muscle freeze 3oz and cost 65 dollars and was as helpful as I thought it‚Äôd be‚Ä¶ so I researched and researched and made my own.. custom for major pain and it freaking works!! Works miracles, friends family friends off family have been buying it as a God send.. so I thought I‚Äôd share link with yall. Not just to market but because it really works and has gotten me through so many bad days.. I hope it can work for you too!!

 I signed up for this forum months ago after my spine health forum was moved to Facebook.  
 I have battled with Neuropathy pain and many other issues since my two failed back to back lumbar fusions. I miss the peer input on SH with other sufferers and learning about potential treatments for chronic pain, and I don‚Äôt like Facebook.  Not very outgoing I waited until now to post.  
 Pleased to meet you all

 Hey everyone! I‚Äôm new to this community but not new to the concept of being in pain. All you have to do is believe in yourself and trust your efforts. We all will get through. Hang in there. Take care. Stay safe.

 Hi, 
  My name is Natalie I have Psoriatic Arthritis and neuropathy just about everywhere. I‚Äôm trying to be more positive but it‚Äôs hard. I had neck surgery last year but doesn‚Äôt seem to help. I go to pain management but is very discouraging, they don‚Äôt treat me like a patient and I don‚Äôt like that. I‚Äôm in pain most of the day, I miss my old life. Well I promised someone I would do this and I did. Thanks.

 Hi, I have Arachnoiditis Most Dr‚Äôs have no idea what that is. All they want me to do is more injections and other procedures including more surgeries. 
 I‚Äôve had my first surgery in 1999 for a laminectomy and the second in 2000 was for installing rods and screws where the disc was removed. Pain just kept getting worse. Then came the injections. Those did absolutely nothing and may have caused my Arachnoiditis. I‚Äôm told they may have pierced my spinal cord. 
 So now 18 years of being on pain meds. Most have been prescribed in those years by my primary care physician. For some reason with the health system I go to, my PCP keep disappearing. They either get fired, change profession, quit or whatever and I get a new one. Each time I go thru hoops to continue my meds. This time the new one wants nothing to do with my meds. He sent me to a Pain Management Dr. and they want me to go thru more injections. They even mentioned Medical Marijuana but I‚Äôm not sure that will help.  
 This is NOT good!

 Newbie here. I have so many questions. Anybody familiar with the book ‚ÄúFreedom from Pain‚Äù by Levine and Phillips? Do any of you have PTSD from childhood? Any hints for applying for disability? etc., etc. 
 Me: Not much cartilage in one hip and both knees. One bionic hip that‚Äôs okay. Hard to stand for even 10 minutes. Been healing severe emotional, mental and spiritual wounds for 30 years. Now my physical pain has gotten to a severe level, and I need to face it. 
 I‚Äôm very interested in the psychology of pain. 
I hope there is a place for me here. 
 Thank you.

 Hi everyone, 
I am joining this forum to find others with similar stories as my own. 
In Dec.2007 I was told I need surgery to fuse my L4 and L5 together due to a herniated disc. I was told that the surgeon would need to go in through my stomach due to my situation. 
Day of my surgery comes and my surgeon informs me that we have had a change of plans and are going to be doing a newer, less evasive surgery called an axialift. At the time I heard less evasive and I was all for it. What I did not hear was the ‚Äù new‚Äù part. Later I found out that my surgeon had not done this procedure prior to my surgery, and did not perform it correctly on me. 
Needless to say, surgery did not go so well. My surgeon was able to fuse the two vertebrae with a steel rod, however while doing so through this tiny hole in my tailbone he proceeded to push a portion of my herniated disk straight into one of my spinal nerve roots. (This  was something I learned later). After surgery I was out on the regular recovery dose of pain meds and 8 weeks later found I was still in pain. In fact the pain now was WORSE than prior to surgery. My surgeon did another MRI and tells me that part of my disc is in my nerve root and a second surgery is needed to remove it. 
Feb. 2008 I have a second surgery, which was much more evasive. Upon entry my surgeon discovered that the nerve root has begun growing around the disc and it would be dangerous to remove at the time because of a great chance of paralysis. Instead he performs a laminectomy(spelling?) and removes the bones around this area to alleviate pressure on the disc. He then installs a cage of steel along with several screws to keep my spine together. This, however did nothing to alleviate the pain. 
Fast forward 12 years of pain management, starting out with Percocet only, then going through many others like Opana, Fentanyl patches, Oxycontin, ect. Then the state of Tennessee cracked down on opioids, and put a maximum dose Drs can prescribe monthly. I was WAY over that limit. My pain management Dr.told me the only way to get around the limits are through a pain pump being installed in my body and the medicine going into my spinal membrane. 
I had the pump put in about 4 years ago, and it was rough going from day one. They started with Morphine, it did not even cut a quarter of my pain and I gain a very substantial amount of weight. They then went to Dilaudid and I turned purple everywhere. If I would not have been in so much pain, it would have been hilarious. We then went to Fentanyl, since the patches worked for me, we thought the pump would too. I finally am getting about 50% of my pain relieved. With Percocet at the state level limits on top of my pump I am a functional human being. I am able to work full time ( however at times it gets tough if I have to sit or stand too long at a time). We continue to adjust my Fentanyl levels trying to maximize it‚Äôs role in my treatment. Ideally I would love to eliminate oral meds all together, but we have not gotten there yet, and I am unsure we ever will. 
However my story is not to discourage anyone, only to inform others that there are many treatments available for pain. We moved to 7 different states in the past 12 years, so it has been difficult getting good pain management Drs who believe your pain is real and is willing to help. I have had a few quacks over my time, and have been gone into withdrawal a couple times because of those doctors. I had one Dr in Alabama who refused to give me my meds ( prior to pump) unless I had useless procedures ( epidurals, ect) done monthly. They never helped, but the Dr needed to pad his bill. I reported him to the insurance company and was referred elsewhere. 
The fight is real my friends!! I have gone to Drs and pharmacies where they treat you like a junky, because even though they got into their professions to help, they really do not understand. Not to mention all the idiots making it impossible to get the proper dosages and treatments because they decided to sell their meds or abuse them. I hate that!!! 
Stay strong everyone, 
Heather

 Heather, I am so sorry to hear about your struggle.  I am also in a similar situation with my pain and have been through doctors, PT, hypnosis,  CBD, tried smoking,  etc.  My nightmare was having my PMP calling me, asking weird sexual questions late at night, and I  politely refused his questions just evaded so I could still be on my meds.  I finally left PM a few years ago and have been in agony ever since.  I moved ( divorced) and have not yet found a good doctors where I live. 
It is horrible living in pain‚Ä¶ I feel yours!  I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt have any advice but just wanted you to know that there are others suffering with you.   Good wishes sent to you.

 God, this is terrible. I am very sorry. I do not have any advice for you  , I have never struggled with such serious pain, I‚Äôm really sorry :((

 I am a military spouse.  I woke up one day 6 years ago in horrible back pain.  After 3 weeks of the pain I finally decided to go to the dr on base.  I was told it was a pulled muscle.  Well it never went away.  From that point on I had to fight with 4 different drs who said I was drug seeking, I kept asking for an MRI.  I finally got one and my drs nurse called me and said I have two bulging disks and that the dr no longer would be my doctor anymore.  I was dismissed and no one cared.  Family from that point on kept saying they have pain too and they dont need pain meds and that its not that bad.  Fast forward, a surgeon said I need a laminectomy off base clinic since the drs on base would no longer treat me.  The surgery went horrible, 6 weeks later they had to go back in because of fluid that may or may not have been an infection, from this surgery I formed scar tissue on my nerves next to the bulging disks.  They told me scar tissue doesn‚Äôt cause pain.  Finally when we moved to a different state, I was finally treated for my pain and thought about the spinal cord stimulator, but not pressured into it.  I finally had it done.  We received orders right after the surgery.  We were going to Japan.  But after the military did our medical clearance because I was on pain meds. , they told my husband they denied for me to go.  So I had to move back home (that was a nightmare), and the drs there had to remove the battery and put it in the correct spot because the surgeon didn‚Äôt stitch it into the muscle and it kept twisting and moved to my spine.  While they did the surgery after I said goodbye to my husband for two years, they pulled me off of all meds.  Detoxing after that surgery was absolute inhumane torture.  So now I was all alone trying to take care of our two kids and the spinal cord stimulator didn‚Äôt help with the scar tissue pain.  Family told my husband they would help me, they never did.  I got a ride to and from the hospital, then told how lucky I am because the dr gave me 5 low dose pills of pain meds and I will be fine. I had 3 months of insomnia, I never knew anyone could still be alive after that long without sleep.  The drs wouldn‚Äôt help me and said sleep meds aren‚Äôt good for anyone.  I would rock back and forth all night long on the edge of my bed in so much pain and I felt so alone and so helpless.  Hes home now and we moved again and I had to start with new drs again.  Now they say that the reason my scs doesn‚Äôt work is because the leads are way to high in my spinal cord.  But that I can‚Äôt be on pain meds because its bad.  So here I am again, in bed.  Yes I have gone to several ERs for pain and I get yelled at, dismissed with out an exam, all the time.  One time I was crying for 9 days and finally went to the ER.  I couldn‚Äôt hold still for an MRI because I was having muscle spasms or at least thats what I thought.  They yelled at me for not being still and put me back in the room to tell me I was drug seeking.  After finally calling my rep, she told me what I was decribing to her was constant shocks from the spinal cord stimulator, and to turn it off and then come see her for a reprogramming.  I am so traumatized and my husband says I am not pleasant to be around because the pain makes me crabby and that I make the kids feel like I dont want to be around them because its hard for me to sit still for family movie nights.  I feel so alone and I do have PTSD from all of this.  Im looking for anyone who has been in chronic pain and I don‚Äôt like feeling all alone.

 I‚Äôm about 50 and for the last 10 years I suffer from chronic pain in my lower back. 
I‚Äôm on medication for 10 years now but my quality of life has been damaged due to using these medication. 
I‚Äôm looking  for natural solution. so far I‚Äôve tried Soft Laser for pain relief but it feels like a placebo, it didn‚Äôt do a thing. 
Does anyone own experience with any other home use device? 
Will be happy to hear. 
Thanks in advance, 
Chuck

 Hi, my name is Heather. 
I am 27 years old and have been living with chronic RA pain for about 11 years now, and this past year has been really rough. 
It‚Äôs hard for me to talk to others in my life who don‚Äôt really understand what I‚Äôm going through, and numerous hospital and doctor visits and not having energy to go out and do things like I usually can has left me feeling isolated. 
I was looking online at online chat groups to hoping meet some new friends and found this place üôÇ 
Thanks for having me!

 Hi Heather 
I just joined and it doesn‚Äôt seem like there is much activity going on. I know there is no shortage of people suffering from chronic pain. I‚Äôm sorry to hear you are one of them. I suffer from chronic back pain from a spinal fusion gone every way but good. I hope you can find some relief. Hopefully, I can catch you in the chat sometime. Take care.
